            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thus then conceiue we the meaning of the Apoſtle in the words of this verſe, as if he had ſaid; <hi>Now then ſince it is ſo as I haue ſhewed before, that Gods elect are iuſtified freely by Gods grace and faith in Ieſus Chriſt, though I feele ſinne ſtill abiding in me, yet I being able to bleſſe God for deliuerance through Ieſus Chriſt, it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that all ſuch as are one with Chriſt, and are knit and ioyned to Chriſt as members to the head, and as branches to the vine, by the bond of the Spirit and by faith, though they haue ſinne ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in them, yet they are freed by the ſatisfactorie death of Chriſt from the guiltineſſe of ſinne, and from the puniſhment due to them for ſinne, euen from the curſe of the Law, from all plagues and iudgements in this world, and from euerlasting perdition in the world to come: they ſhall not come into condemnation, and they are ſuch as liue not according to the motion and guidance of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature, but according to the motion and guidance of the Spirit of grace and ſanctification.</hi>

Thus he orders his ſpeech in great wiſedome: and hence note we thus much.</p>
               <p>That the priuiledge of Gods grace and fauour, of Gods mercy, and of comfort in Chriſt Ieſus, freedome from hell; death &amp; damnation, is not to be reſtrained to ſome particular
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:492:6"/> perſons, as haply ſuch as haue a great meaſure of grace, ſuch as the Apoſtle was, but it is common to all and euery true beleeuer, all that truly beleeue in Chriſt, and are one with him by his ſpirit and by faith: though their faith be weake, yet they truly beleeuing in Chriſt, and their faith being a true faith, they haue right and title to all the ſauing comforts in Chriſt; and they are free from hell, death and damnation, as well as thoſe that haue the greateſt meaſure of grace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. And hence it is that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2. Pet. 1.1.<note place="margin">2.

Ioh. 1.2, 3.<note place="margin">1.

And therefore the priuiledge of Gods grace and fauour, of comfort in Chriſt, and of freedome from hell, death and damnation, belongs to all and euery true beleeuer, as well as to the holy Apoſtle. 2. Tim. 4.8. The Apoſtle hauing ſaid, <hi>Henceforth is laid vp for me the crowne of righteouſneſſe, which the Lord the righteous Iudge ſhall giue me at that day:</hi> he ſubioynes, <hi>and not to me onely, but vnto all them alſo that loue his appearing.</hi> Plainly teaching, that the greateſt mercy of God, euen eternall life and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not to be appropriated to the Apoſtles, or to ſuch as they were, men of the greateſt meaſure of grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but it belongs to all and euery true beleeuer, and it ſhall be giuen to them.

Yea the word of God, the word of comfort, is a word of terror and bitterneſſe to them: the ſeales of the couenant are ſeales of iudgement and damnation to them, and there is but a ſtep betweene them and hell, there is no difference betweene them and thoſe that now lie frying in the fire of hell, but this, they who are in hell are paſt recouery, and theſe in Gods great patience are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for a time, how long or how ſhort they know not, to ſee if they will accept grace offered to them.</hi> A thing that if it be duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, may ſhake the heart of the moſt deboſhed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane wretch in the world: and if hell haue not taken full poſſeſſion of his ſoule, may moue him to bethinke himſelfe of ſpeedy reformation. But if thou haſt euidence to thine owne ſoule, that thou art in Chriſt, comfort thy ſelfe, nothing ſhall hurt thee, neither ſinne nor any miſerie that befalls thee can hurt thee, no not death it ſelfe; the ſting of death is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and taken from thee by the death of Chriſt: yea when thou art dead, thou ſhalt not come into the iudgement of condemnation: thinke on that to thy comfort.</p>

                  <note place="margin">An anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſticall cauill anſwered.</note>Now here before we leaue this point, a cauill of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts is to be met withall: Say they, is it ſo, that ſuch as are in Chriſt, are by Chriſt freed from the guiltineſſe of ſinne, then (ſay they) it muſt needs follow, that they are freed from ſubiection, true beleeuers are not to be ſubiect to any on the earth, to kings, to magiſtrates, and to other gouernors: ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of man to man came in by ſinne as a puniſhment, Gen. 3.16.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.16.</note> After the fall <hi>Eue</hi> was put in ſubiection to <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:492:9"/> and therefore ſinne and all puniſhment due to ſinne being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from them that are in Chriſt Ieſus, they are not to be ſubiect to any that liue on the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>Now for anſwer to this, we muſt know, that there is a twofold ſubiection of man to man, one ciuill, and the other ſeruile or ſlauiſh. Ciuill ſubiection, is whereby one man is ſubiect to another for the common good, euen for the good of them both, as the Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 13.4.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.4.</note> 
                  <hi>The magiſtrate is the miniſter of God for the wealth of the inferiour.</hi> Seruile or ſlauiſh ſubiection, is that whereby a ſlaue or vaſſall is in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection onely for the good of his Lord and maiſter. The firſt of theſe, namely ciuill ſubiection, was before the fall in the ſtate of innocencie, as appeares in the Apoſtles manner of reaſoning, 1. Tim. 2.12, 13.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.12.13.</note> But the ſecond ſeruile or ſlauiſh ſubiection came in by ſinne: and for the place alledged, Gen. 3.16. it is not ſo to be vnderſtood, as if ciuill ſubiection ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply conſidered in it ſelfe, had not bene before the fall, but that by the fall conſtrained ſubiection ioyned with paine, ſorrow and griefe came in, which before in time of innocencie was with pleaſure: as before the fall, man was to labour in dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the garden, Gen. 2.15.<note place="margin">Gen. 2.15.</note> yet his labour was with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but after the fall it was ioyned with paine, ſorrow, and griefe. So doubtleſſe ſubiection with pleaſure was before the fall, but after the fall it was ioyned with paine, ſorrow, and griefe, and therefore it is not true which the Anabaptiſts ſay, that ciuill ſubiection of man to man ſimply conſidered in it ſelfe, came in by ſinne as a puniſhment. No, I dare affirme, that ciuill ſubiection of man to man, now ſince the fall ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply conſidered in it ſelfe, it is not a curſe, it is not a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a neceſſarie ordinance of God, for the good of the Church and Commonwealth: and ſo it is but an idle cauill of the Anabaptiſts to ſay, that ſuch as are in Chriſt are freed from all puniſhment of ſinne, and therefore freed from ciuill ſubiection.</p>
               <p>Obſerue we farther, that the Apoſtle makes the ground of freedome from the guiltineſſe of ſinne, and from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to ſinne, to be in Chriſt, euen Gods mercy in him,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:492:10"/> and the merit of his death: and the concluſion hence is briefly this:</p>

And ſurely thoſe humaine ſatisfactions do much derogate from Gods free grace, from the infinite merit of Chriſt his death.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:492:10"/> Admit this (which the Papiſts can neuer proue,) that ſome good workes done by true beleeuers are moſt perfect accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the exact rule of Gods Law, yet cannot thoſe good workes ſo done, cauſe or procure freedome from the leaſt of their ſinnes. It is no part of Gods promiſe annexed to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of workes, that any good worke, done according to the exact rule of his Law, ſhall ſatisfie for any ſinne: the Lord ſaith not, do this and thou ſhalt liue, and if thou faile and breake my Law, thou ſhalt by ſome good workes done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exact rule of my Law, make amends and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for that breach. No, there is no ſuch matter: the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perfect obedience propounded in the morall Law of God once broken, there can be no compenſation made for that breach but by puniſhment, either in the perſon offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or ſome other in his ſtead: and therefore no good thing in vs, or done by vs, (admit it be moſt perfect) can cauſe or procure freedome from the leaſt of our ſinnes. No, we muſt renounce all things in our ſelues, and done by vs, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo excellent, as inſufficient to cauſe or procure freedome from the leaſt of our ſinnes: and for freedome from our ſins we muſt cleaue onely to the free grace of God, and to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit merit of Chriſt his death, as the ſufficient and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe of the ſame.

               <p>Obſerue we further, as the Apoſtle maketh Ieſus Chriſt the ground of freedome from condemnation, ſo he limits and reſtraines, and appropriates that benefit to thoſe onely that are in Chriſt Ieſus.

               <p>Come we now to the ſecond generall thing in this verſe, the infallible marke by which the Apoſtle points out thoſe that are freed from condemnation by the death of Chriſt, they being in Chriſt, namely this: That they are ſuch as walke after the Spirit and not after the fleſh, that is, ſuch as liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the motion and guidance of the Spirit of grace and ſanctification, as they are moued and guided by the Spirit, and not according to the motion and guidance of the corruption of nature. Now this we are to take, as the Apoſtle here giues it, as an infallible marke of ſuch as are freed from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by Chriſt, that ſuch perſons are thus qualified, that they walke after the Spirit. The Papiſts take this as if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had put it downe as the cauſe of freedome from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus: That therefore there is no condemnation to them, becauſe they walke not after the fleſh but after the Spirit; and ſo they would hence ground an argument againſt iuſtification in Gods ſight by faith alone, and go about to proue from hence, that true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:492:14"/> are iuſtified in the ſight of God, not only by faith, but alſo by their walking after the Spirit, &amp; by their good works, but they are much deceiued.<note place="margin">A Popiſh ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill anſwered.</note> The Apoſtle here makes not walking after the Spirit the cauſe of freedome from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but the condition of ſuch as are freed, and a ſpeeciall note by which they may be knowne. He ſaith not: there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus, becauſe they walke after the Spirit; but they do walke after the Spirit, they are thus qualified, they are ſuch as walke not after the fleſh but after the Spirit. And inded it cannot be, that walking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Spirit ſhould be a cauſe of freedome from condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe walking after the Spirit in order of nature, is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter freedome from condemnation. Men are firſt in Chriſt, and by him freed from condemnation, and haue his Spirit in them, and then they walke after the Spirit. And therefore the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts depraue and abuſe this text, in that they make walking after the Spirit, the cauſe of freedome from condemnation. Come we to matter of inſtruction hence offered: firſt, in that the Apoſtle here makes walking after the Spirit an infallible marke of ſuch as are in Chriſt, and by him are freed from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, we may conclude.</p>
               <p>That whoſoeuer they be that are in Chriſt, and by him are <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>6</label> freed from condemnation, they haue this marke on them;<note place="margin">Such as are in Chriſt they liue an holy and ſanctified life.</note> that they walke after the Spirit, they are thus qualified, and they haue this certainly found in them, that they liue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the motion and guidance of the Spirit of grace and ſanctification. Or briefly thus.</p>
               <p>Such as are in Chriſt, euen one with him by the bond of his Spirit, and by him are freed from condemnation, they liue an holy and a ſanctified life: their life is a life of grace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and they do euidence and teſtifie their being in Chriſt, by their holy thoughts, words and workes. And hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, 2. Cor. 5.17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, let him be a new creature,</hi> or as it is in the new tranſlation, <hi>he is a new creature:</hi> for it may be put downe poſitiuely; he that is in Chriſt, he is a new creature, he liues not as he was wont, but he liues a new life, euen an holy and ſanctified life, 1. Ioh. 1.6.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:492:15"/> 
                  <hi>If we ſay that we haue fellowſhip with him, and walke in darkneſſe, we lye, and do not truly:</hi> as if he had ſaid; he deceiues himſelfe that ſaith he hath fellowſhip with Chriſt, and yet walkes in darkneſſe. He that hath fellowſhip with him is certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and hath true ſauing knowledge, and he walkes anſwerable to it. 1. Iohn 3.6. <hi>Whoſoeuer abideth in him, ſinneth not,</hi> that is, makes not a common trade and practiſe of ſinne, but his life is holy and ſanctified. And to theſe we might adde other teſtimonies of Scripture clearing and confirming this truth, that ſuch as be in Chriſt, euen one with him, by him are freed from condemnation they liue an holy and ſanctified life, their life is a life of grace and holineſſe, and the reaſons and grounds of it are theſe. <label type="milestone">

The point hence is this.</p>
               <p>That the walking of the godly, true beleeuers, ſuch as are <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>7</label> in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Such as are in Chriſt are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (to preuent an obiection) this is not ſo to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if Gods children did neuer trip or ſlip awrie, nor at any time ſlide out of the way of holineſſe, and did neuer fall into any ſinne, we are not ſo to conceiue the point: for then none liuing on the face of the earth, ſhould be ſaid to walke after the Spirit, becauſe there is none that liues and ſinnes not, but thus vnderſtand the point. That howſoeuer Gods children, true beleeuers, and ſuch as are in Chriſt, do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſlip and ſlide, and againſt their purpoſe fall into ſome ſinne; yet the courſe of their life, and their thoughts, and words, and actions, for the tenour of them, and for the moſt and greateſt part, are holy, and good, and ſpirituall; and they are ordered and guided by the motion of Gods Spirit: yea euen when they do ſlip, and fall, and are ouertaken with ſome ſinne, therein alſo grace hath a working in them, not to the acting of ſinne, but to curbe and reſtraine the fleſh, that the

Thus it is with the godly, true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and ſuch as are in Chriſt. And to this purpoſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeakes plainly, Philip. 3.20.

               <p>Obſerue we yet further; the Apoſtle hauing ſet this marke on ſuch as are in Chriſt, and by him are freed from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that they walke after the Spirit; he there ſtayes not, but he addes a deniall of the contrary, that they walke not after the fleſh: he ſaith, they walke after the Spirit, not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh.

Theſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture do plainly euince and proue the point in hand, that a man cannot poſſibly walke both after the fleſh and after the Spirit: the courſe of a mans life, and his wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king cannot be good, holy, heauenly, and ſpirituall, and at the ſame time earthly, carnall, and meerely naturall and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall.</p>

And therefore it muſt needs be, that ſuch as walke after the fleſh and not after the Spirit, they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried contrarie waies, according to their contrary affections and likings.

Some would haue this verſe to be a proofe and confirmation of the latter part of the former verſe, namely, of that which the Apoſtle affirmes of ſuch as are in Chriſt, that they walke not after the fleſh, but they walke after the Spirit. Say they, the Apoſtle confirmes that part of the verſe by an argument from the efficient cauſe of an holy and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified life, namely, the Spirit of Chriſt giuen to ſuch as are in Chriſt, and haue fellowſhip &amp; communion with him. But indeed this verſe is rather to be taken as a proofe and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the former part of the verſe foregoing. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles propoſition, there is no condemnation to ſuch as are in Chriſt, that is moſt agreeable to the context, and to the drift &amp; purpoſe of the Apoſtle. For hauing ſaid there is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus; ſome might haply thinke or ſay, Is there no condemnation to ſuch as are in Chriſt? why, they that are in Chriſt Ieſus haue in them a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of corruption, there is impureneſſe and defilement in part in all the powers of their ſoules, and in all the parts of their bodies: the impureneſſe of nature is found in the beſt and in the moſt holy that liue in the world, &amp; that is enough to condemne them; how then are they freed from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? This obiection the Apoſtle here meetes withall, and preuents, and makes anſwer to it on this manner: Howſoeuer the beſt and the moſt holy that liue in the world haue in them impureneſſe of nature, which in it ſelfe and of it ſelfe, is enough to condemne them; and euen for that, if there were no further matter of condemnation in them, the Lord might
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:492:22"/> iuſtly throw them to hell, yet there is that in Chriſt Ieſus that is able to free them from it: yea there is that in Chriſt Ieſus, euen the law of the Spirit of life, that doth free all that are in him from the law of ſinne and of death: therefore there can be no condemnation to them. So the Apoſtle here reaſons, and that is the dependance of this verſe on the former.</p>
               <p>Now in this verſe, for the generall matter of it,<note place="margin">The generall matter of the ſecond verſe.</note> we haue theſe things layd before vs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what it is that ſets them that are in Chriſt Ieſus free from their guiltineſſe in reſpect of their impure nature, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> from the power it hath in it ſelfe to condemne them, namely, the Spirit of life; which the Apoſtle deliuers, together with the power of it, vnder the word <hi>Law;</hi> and the ſubiect of it, in whom that Spirit of life is found, and that is in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: <hi>For the law of the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Apoſtle makes knowne the effect and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> worke of that Spirit of life: that the effect of it is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; giuing inſtance of that effect in himſelfe, and in his owne particular, ſetting it downe in the time paſt: <hi>hath freed me.</hi> And to that he addes in the third place, from what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> was freed, and from what all that are in Chriſt Ieſus are freed, by the power of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Ieſus, in the laſt wordes, <hi>from the law of ſinne and of death:</hi> and ſo we ſee the ſumme and ſubſtance of this verſe.

               <p>This verſe doth much trouble Interpreters,<note place="margin">Interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> and is diuerſly taken according to the diuerſe applications of it, ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it (as I ſaid) as a proofe of the latter part of the verſe foregoing, and ſome as a confirmation of the former part of it, which (as I haue ſhewed) I take to be the right applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. And I doubt not but that this verſe and the two verſes following, are to be taken as intended by the Apoſtle, touching the matter of Iuſtification, and freedome from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and not concerning the ſanctification of ſuch as are in Chriſt: the context and words (as I conceiue) will beare no other ſound expoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Law of the Spirit of life.</hi> Theſe words <hi>(of the Spirit of

I will not trouble you with the varietie of expoſitions, but giue that which I conceiue to be the true meaning of them, and moſt agreeable to the purpoſe of the Apoſtle. And the Spirit of life (as I take it) is here put for life, according to the phraſe of Scripture, as Reuela. 11.11. <hi>After three dayes and an halfe the Spirit of life comming from God ſhall enter into them:</hi> that is, life it ſelfe. Now life is that whereby a thing acteth and moueth it ſelfe, and it is the cauſe and beginning of action and motion: and being here applied to Chriſt, we are to vnderſtand it of that in Chriſt which is the cauſe and beginning of all his holy actions. Now what is that? Why, ſurely his originall holineſſe and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the holineſſe and purity of his humane nature, which is here called the Spirit of life for two reaſons.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> Secondly, becauſe of the perfection of it, it being moſt exact, and abſolute, and perfect. It is vſuall in the Scripture to ſet out a thing in the perfection of it, and to the full, by adding the word <hi>Spirit</hi> vnto it; as the ſpirit of pride, of truth, of errour, and the like. So then the meaning of this phraſe <hi>(the Spirit of life)</hi> is this, the moſt abſolute and moſt perfect purity and holineſſe of the nature of man. And the word <hi>law</hi> here vſed, ſignifieth the power of that holineſſe and purity to countermand the power of ſinne, to acquit and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from ſinne: and that may be caſily gathered from the oppoſition of it to the law of ſinne. <hi>(In Chriſt Ieſus)</hi> So is the text originall, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the law of the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> The meaning is, which is inherent in Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, as the proper ſubiect of it. <hi>Hath freed me,</hi> that is, me being in Chriſt Ieſus, and one with him by the bond of his Spirit, and by faith: hath perfectly freed me
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:492:23"/> being imputed to me. For here no doubt the Apoſtle had an eye to that in the verſe before, <hi>(There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus.) (From the law of ſinne, and of death.)</hi> The word <hi>ſinne,</hi> here ſignifieth the corruption, the blot and ſtaine of nature: and in reſpect of the Apoſtle and true beleeuers, the reliques and remainders of that blot and ſtaine ſtill abiding in them: and by <hi>the law of ſinne,</hi> is meant that force and power it hath in it ſelfe, to make guilty in Gods ſight, and to bind ouer to puniſhment. And laſt of all, by the <hi>law of death,</hi> we are to vnderſtand the power of death, both of body and ſoule, both temporall and eternall, due to that blot and ſtaine. Thus then briefly conceiue we the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apoſtle in the words of this verſe, as if he had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the power of the moſt abſolute and most perfect holineſſe and purity of the nature of man, which is found in Chriſt Ieſus, is inherent in him as the proper ſubiect of it, euen the power and force it hath to acquit and diſcharge from ſinne, that being imputed to me, hath perfectly freed and deliuered me, I being in Chriſt Ieſus, and one with him by the bond of his Spirit and by faith, from the power which the remainder of ſinne, the blot and ſtaine of my ſinfull nature, hath to make me guilty in Gods ſight, and to bind me ouer to puniſhment, and from the power of death both of body and ſoule, euen of death temporall, and of death eternall, due to me in reſpect of that blot and ſtaine of my corrupt and ſinfull nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerue we that this verſe hath reſpect to the firſt part of the former verſe, as a preuention of an obiection: for ſome might obiect and ſay, There is impureneſſe of nature in the beſt and moſt holy that liue in the world, how then are they freed from condemnation? This the Apoſtle meets with, and anſwers, That the perfect holineſſe and purity of Chriſt his manhood imputed to them, perfectly frees them from the power the defilement of their nature hath to condemne them, and it ſhall neuer condemne them; and ſo it is a truth that there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.

               <p>In the next place obſerue we, how the Apoſtle here ſets out the holineſſe and puritie of Chriſt his humane nature: he cals it not the life of the Spirit, or the life of grace, but which is more emphaticall and weighty, and more ſets out the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie and perfection of it, <hi>(The Spirit of life) which is in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Hence we are giuen to vnderſtand thus much.</p>
               <p>That in Chriſt is not onely the life of the Spirit, or the life <label type="milestone">

                  </label> and moſt exact, and perfect. But here a queſtion may be moued: whether Chriſt in his conception and birth, had ſuch a perfection of grace as could admit no increaſe, or no? <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> To this I anſwer: No, he had not, in his manhood he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in grace as he did in age and in ſtature: the text is cleare, Luke 2.52. <hi>Ieſus increaſed in wiſedome and ſtature, and in fauour with God and men.</hi> And this increaſe was not onely in reſpect of experience, and the manifeſtation of grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and men, as the Schoolemen hold, but in reſpect of the habit or gift of grace. Yet ſo are we to vnderſtand it, as that it was an increaſe without all imperfection, there was not the leaſt imperfection, the leaſt defect in that grace that was in Chriſt in his infancy. In his infancy he receiued a full meaſure of grace, and euen fulneſſe of grace agreeable to that age, and fit for that age, and the workes to be done of him in that age. And when he was twelue yeares old he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a further meaſure fit for that age: and ſo when he was thirty yeares old, and was baptized, and began to preach, then was accompliſhed the Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſai. 61.1.</note> 
                  <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is on me, becauſe he hath annointed me, that I ſhould preach the Gospell to the poore: he hath ſent me that I ſhould heale the broken hearted, that I ſhould preach deliuerance to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, and recouering of ſight to the blind, that I ſhould ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie them that are bruiſed.</hi> Luke 4.18.<note place="margin">Luke 4.18.</note> And then he had the full growth of grace; and this increaſe of grace, and a perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of grace may well ſtand together. As it pleaſed Chriſt to take to himſelfe the body of an infant, and to grow vp in ſtature of body; ſo alſo it pleaſed him to take a fulneſſe of grace agreeable to that age, and to grow and increaſe in grace: and ſo the holineſſe and puritie infuſed into Chriſt, and inherent in his manhood, was euen from his conception a perfect meaſure of grace, and being come to the full growth it is moſt abſolute, and moſt exact and perfect, and it was needfull ſo to be. There is reaſon why it ſhould ſo be, that the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:492:26"/> holineſſe and puritie infuſed into Chriſt, and inherent in his humane nature, ſhould be moſt abſolute and perfect, and that he ſhould be free from all ſpot of ſinne, and haue abſolute fulneſſe of grace and holineſſe in him, euen holineſſe in the higheſt degree of perfection.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> They are eaſily anſwered. For firſt grant this, that the law of the Spirit of life doth free from ſinne, taking the law of the Spirit of life for the grace of regeneration, (which indeed is not the meaning of that phraſe in this place, as we ſhewed in opening the text,) yet grant that to be the meaning, they gaine nothing by it: it followes not thereupon, that the grace of regeneration doth free from ſinne: but how? <hi>Quoad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriale, non quoad formale:</hi> in that it doth purge out and bridle the euill motions and ſinfull luſts of the heart in ſuch as are iuſtified, but it doth not free any that is not iuſtified from the guilt of his ſinne, and acquit and diſcharge from it in the ſight of God: no, there is no ſuch matter. Againe, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith not, the law of the Spirit of life in me, or the law in vs, but <hi>the law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> He makes the ſubiect of that law of the Spirit of life he ſpeakes of, to be Chriſt Ieſus, and not our ſelues; and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be vnderſtood of holineſſe inherent in vs. And further, he ſaith not, the law of the Spirit of life hath freed me from ſinne, but from the law of ſinne. So that ſtill admit that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:492:30"/> to be good, that by the Law of the Spirit of life, is meant the grace of regeneration; yet that will not follow which the Papiſts do inferre on it, that the grace of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration doth iuſtifie in the ſight of God: but onely this will follow on it, that the grace of regeneration doth free from the power and dominion of ſinne. And therefore this text makes nothing for that the Papiſts would faſten on it, and which they would conclude from it.</p>
               <p>Obſerue we further, the Apoſtle here aſcribes a power to ſinne: and vnderſtanding by <hi>ſinne,</hi> (as I ſhewed) the impure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and defilement of nature, euen a power to make guilty in Gods ſight, and to binde ouer to death, to death of body and death of ſoule, death temporall, and death eternall, he puts them together, and conioynes them: and the point hence is this.</p>
               <p>That the impureneſſe and defilement of nature, if no other <label type="milestone">

We are to be humbled for the impureneſſe of our nature, &amp; to make our peace with the Lord: for to that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:492:32"/> end he ſpares vs, that beſides the acknowledgement of his goodneſſe and mercy, we ſhould be humbled before him, and make our peace with him, not onely in reſpect of our actuall ſinnes, but euen for the impureneſſe of our nature: we haue cauſe to be humbled for that, as well as for our actuall ſinnes, for euen for that if we had no other ſinne, might the Lord iuſtly powre out his full wrath vpon vs in this life, and for euer in the life to come. Alas, many conſider not what an euill their corrupt nature is, and they are neuer troubled in reſpect of thoſe euill motions and luſts that ariſe from their owne corruption: and many full little conſider that the Sonne of God muſt come downe from heauen, and humble himſelfe, and become a man, that he might free Gods choſen from the impureneſſe and defilement of their nature. They thinke not on this, alas, their eyes are ſhut vp, they ſee it not: no, they bleſſe themſelues in reſpect of their ciuill, honeſt, orderly carriage, and thinke all is well with them, if they liue in ciuill faſhion in the world, and be free from foule and groſſe ſinnes, ſuch as the world takes notice of. Poore ſoules, they ſee not the impureneſſe of their hearts, and that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that they are lyable to death of bodie and death of ſoule. Let vs then learne to take notice of it, that <hi>our owne clothes will make vs filthy, and plonge vs in the pit.</hi> Iob 9.31. that the impureneſſe of our nature is enough to condemne vs, if no other ſinne were added to it: and let vs bewaile that, and be humbled for that, as well as for our actuall ſinnes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Gods mercy in ſparing vs, and that he did not throw vs to hell ſo ſoone as we were conceiued in the wombe; he might iuſtly haue done it, but he hath hitherto ſpared vs. Oh then let vs acknowledge and magnifie his goodneſſe, patience, and mercy: and in reſpect of the impure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our nature, euen the beſt of vs haue ſtill a remainder of it ſtill abiding in vs; and in reſpect of that, we haue cauſe to hang downe our heads: let vs I ſay, euen the beſt of vs, in reſpect of the impureneſſe of our nature, learne to walke humbly before the Lord all the dayes of our liues.

The Apoſtle here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes that, from the effect of God his ſending his Sonne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world. And of the Sonne of God his taking fleſh and the nature of man on him, that the effect was the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſinne in that fleſh: and in that humane nature of the Sonne of God, being ſent of his Father into the world, and taking the nature of man on him, he in that nature condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſinne, and ſo freed all true beleeuers from the impure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and defilement of nature: that is the maine drift of the Apoſtle in this verſe, and the reſpect it hath to the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter. In this verſe we haue theſe things offered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the Law could not do that which Chriſt did,<note place="margin">The generall matter of the third verſe.</note> there was an impoſſibilitie in the Law to do it. Why? becauſe it was weake, and wanted power to that purpoſe. <hi>That which was impoſſible to the Law, in as much as it was weake,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. And leſt he ſhould ſeeme to wrong the Law, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines himſelfe and ſaith, the weakneſſe of it was in regard of the fleſh, <hi>it was weake becauſe of the fleſh.</hi> And then:</p>
               <p>Secondly, we haue here laid before vs what Chriſt did, namely this, that he condemned ſinne, and wherein it was that he condemned ſinne, that it was in the fleſh. And this effect and working of Chriſt, the condemning of ſinne in the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:492:33"/> fleſh, the Apoſtle doth not barely deliuer, but he ſets it down together with another ſpeciall worke of God going before it, and that was the ſending of Chriſt into the world; that God ſent his owne Sonne into the world, to be incarnate, and to take the nature of man on him, which is further am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by a particular end of his ſending in the fleſh, that it was for ſinne. <hi>God ſending his owne Sonne, in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſinne:</hi> and then followes the effect: That he being ſo ſent, he condemned ſinne in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The drift of it</note>Touching this verſe in generall, as I ſaid, it is to be taken as intended by the Apoſtle, touching the matter of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not concerning ſanctification. The whole matter of it, if we duly obſerue it, tends to ſet forth iuſtification: for here the Apoſtle ſhewes that the Law cannot iuſtifie, that the Law cannot bring to Gods choſen perfect holineſſe and puritie. Though the Law command and require perfect righteouſneſſe, both of nature and actions, yet it brings not perfect holineſſe and puritie to Gods choſen: it is onely Chriſt Ieſus being ſent of his Father, and taking fleſh on him, that condemnes ſinne in his fleſh, and brings ſuch a perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of holineſſe and puritie to Gods choſen, as being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them, makes them perfectly holy and pure in Gods ſight: that is the very purpoſe of the Apoſtle in this verſe. And this verſe being a proofe or an explication of that which is deliuered in the ſecond verſe, it proues ſtrongly againſt all that gaineſay it, that we haue rightly expounded that verſe; and that by <hi>the Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> is meant the perfect holineſſe and puritie of Chriſt his humane nature. And they that cauil and except againſt that expoſition, do it without ground.<note place="margin">Interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
                  <hi>That that was impoſſible to the Law,</hi> or as it is in the new tranſlation, <hi>what the Law could not do:</hi> By the Law, we are to vnderſtand the morall Law of God: and what is the thing the morall Law could not do, we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the laſt clauſe of the verſe, <hi>(condemned ſinne in the fleſh.)</hi> God ſending his owne Sonne in the ſimilitude of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fleſh, condemned ſinne in the fleſh, and that was the thing the Law could not do, it could not condemne ſinne in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:492:33"/> the fleſh, it could not free from ſinne in the ſight of God, and beſtow on men perfect holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, in as much as it was weake, that is, of no force, of no power nor ſtrength to that purpoſe, <hi>becauſe of the fleſh,</hi> or by reaſon of the fleſh. By <hi>fleſh,</hi> is here meant the corruption of nature, that which is in men by naturall generation, as Ioh. 3.6. <hi>That which is borne of the fleſh is fleſh. (God ſending his owne Sonne)</hi> the word <hi>God</hi> here ſtanding in relation to Chriſt, is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken perſonally, for God the Father the firſt perſon in Trinitie. <hi>Sending,</hi> that is, in his eternall counſell hauing deſigned to the office of a Mediator, as Ioh. 10.36. <hi>Say ye of him whom the Father hath ſanctified, and ſent into the world,</hi> did in the fulneſſe of time exhibite him. Galat. 4.4. <hi>When the fulneſſe of time was come, God ſent forth his Sonne,</hi> that is, <hi>his eternall Sonne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of him from all eternitie,</hi> and of the ſame eternall eſſence with the Father, and ſo his onely begotten Sonne, as he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, Ioh. 3.16. <hi>In the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh.</hi> The word <hi>ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> muſt not be here ſimply referred to the fleſh, but to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fleſh. And the meaning is, endued with humane fleſh, and a hauing a true body and a true ſoule, like to our ſinfull bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſoules, but yet free from all ſpot of ſinne in his body and ſoule, as Heb. 4.15. <hi>He was in all things tempted in like ſort, yet without ſinne. (And for ſin.)</hi> Some expound theſe words to be a ſacrifice for ſinne, but they are miſtaken, the Apoſtle here ſpeakes not of Chriſt his ſacrifice or death, but of his incarnation and coming in the fleſh, that he was ſent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came man for ſinne, namely, to take away and to driue ſinne out of our nature, which he tooke on him. For (as <hi>Beza</hi> well obſerues) the Apoſtle ſaith not for ſinnes, but for ſinne, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the blot and ſtaine of nature, which did ſticke in our fleſh, before Chriſt did aſſume and take our fleſh on him, and did fully ſanctifie that aſſumed fleſh. <hi>(Condemned ſinne in the fleſh.)</hi> The word <hi>condemned,</hi> is here put by a metaphoricall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymie, for that which followeth condemnation, namely, for the aboliſhing and taking away of ſinne. As condemned perſons vſe to be cut off, and to be taken out of the world, that they may be no more: ſo the Apoſtle ſaying that Chriſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:492:34"/> condemned ſinne, he meanes, he aboliſhed and tooke ſinne at once quite out of the way: ſo the word is vſed, 1. Pet. 4.6. <hi>In the fleſh,</hi> that is, in the nature of man, euen in that fleſh and humane nature that he aſſumed, he aboliſhed ſinne altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and that fleſh of his being perfectly holy and pure, and the holineſſe of it being imputed to ſuch as are in Chriſt, it takes away the guiltineſſe from them in reſpect of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pureneſſe of their nature, and they thereby are made perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy and pure in Gods ſight. So (as I take it) we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand theſe words, <hi>condemned ſinne in the fleſh.</hi> Thus then conceiue we the meaning of this verſe, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For that which the morall Law of God could not do, which was not poſſible for the Law to do, namely, to free men from ſinne in the ſight of God, and to beſtow on them perfect holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, in as much as it had no force, nor power to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The meaning of the words.</note> 
                  <hi>by reaſon of their naturall corruption: God the Father ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting and ſending into the world his eternall and onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Sonne, whom in his eternall counſell he had deſigned to the office of a Mediator, I ſay, ſending him into the world endued with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fleſh, euen with a true body and a true ſoule, like to our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bodies and ſoules, yet free from all ſpot of ſinne, and that to take away and to driue ſinne, euen the blot and ſtaine of nature out of our nature which he tooke on him, he did indeed in that fleſh and humane nature that he aſſumed, aboliſh ſinne altogether, and tooke it quite out of the way. That fleſh of his being perfectly holy and pure, and the holineſſe of it being imputed to ſuch as are in Chriſt, it frees them from guiltineſſe in reſpect of the impureneſſe of their nature, and they are thereby made perfectly holy and pure in Gods ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle here ſaith: that which was impoſſible for the Law to do, God ſent his Sonne to do for his choſen, and the thing as I ſaid, the Law could not do, was this, it could not free men from ſinne in the ſight of God, it could not bring them perfect holineſſe and righteouſneſſe. Hence then it is cleare.</p>

Some fooliſh ſpirits there be, who thinke they can aſpire to the perfection of the morall Law of God: this is monſtrous and fearefull pride, and we are to take heede of it; we are to be humbled in this reſpect: and though we be regenerate, yet we cannot in our owne perſons in the time of this life, perfectly keepe and fulfill the Law of God.

               <p>Obſerue we further. The Apoſtle here ſaith, the Law was weake and inſufficient to bring Gods choſen perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And why? not through any imperfection in the Law it ſelfe, but becauſe of the fleſh. The weakneſſe and inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the Law, was by reaſon of their owne inbred corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the Apoſtle layes the fault on the fleſh, on the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature, and not on the Law it ſelfe, that it brings not perfect holineſſe to Gods choſen. Whence note we:</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> That we are to blame our ſelues, euen our owne corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Our own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> makes the holy things of God vnfruitfull &amp; vnprofitable to vs, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to do vs good.</note> and not the Law of God, that it brings not to vs perfect holineſſe and righteouſneſſe: our owne corruption makes that weake &amp; vnable to do vs good, which in it ſelfe is ſtrong to that purpoſe. Yea it is true in the generall of the whole word of God, of the Sacraments, and of all the holy things of God; it is our owne fleſh and corruption that makes the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things of God vnfruitfull and vnprofitable to vs, and vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:492:37"/> to do vs good, they being in themſelues, and in their owne nature powerfull meanes of good. The word preached becomes a dead letter to many, they finde no benefit nor comfort by it. Yea as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2. Corinth. 2.16.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.16.</note> it becomes to them <hi>the ſauour of death:</hi> And why? Surely through their owne corruption: becauſe their owne vile and ſinfull hearts are not fit to receiue benefit and comfort by it. So the Sacraments which are ſeales of Gods couenant, and are full of ſweete and heauenly comfort in themſelues, they ſeale vp nothing to ſome but iudgement, 1. Corinth. 11.29.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.29.</note> And why? Surely becauſe of their vnpreparedneſſe: they come to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of them in their blindneſſe of minde, and onely of forme and faſhion, and they will not be turned backe: and ſo the Sacraments become dangerous and hurtfull to them. Well take notice of it whoſoeuer thou art,<note place="margin">A caueat to fruitleſſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the word of God.</note> that art a fruitleſſe and vnprofitable hearer of the word of God, it may be thou haſt liued vnder the meanes a long time, and thou haſt bene a hearer of the word of God many yeares together, and yet thou art ignorant and blind, and thou art ſtill vnreformed in thine heart and life. Where is then the fault? in the word? No, that <hi>is profitable to teach, to improue, to correct, and to inſtruct in righteouſneſſe,</hi> 2. Tim. 3.16.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16.</note> but the fault is in the crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and corruption of thine owne heart; the word of God, the holy things of God are not empty ſhewes and ſhadowes, voyde of all benefit and comfort: no, no, it is thine owne corruption that ſets a barre betweene thee and the comfort and good that is to be found in them: it is that that makes them weake and vnable to yeeld comfort and good to thee; and therefore if thou wouldſt finde good, and comfort, and benefite by the holy things of God, thou muſt purge out the corruption of thine owne heart, and come to the hearing of the word with an honeſt and good heart, an heart hungring and thirſting after the holy inſtructions and comforts of it. Mixe thine hearing with faith, and bring with thee an heart willing to yeeld to the word of God, euen with feare and trembling, hearing it and ſubmitting thy ſelfe to it, when thine owne ſins are met withall, and thou art iuſtly reproued.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:492:38"/> And then doubtleſſe thou ſhalt finde the word to be to thee, as it is in it ſelfe, a word of power, of life, and ſauing comfort to thy ſoule. Come we now to the generall thing layd before vs in this verſe, and that is, what Chriſt did which the Law could not do, as namely this, that he condemned ſinne in the fleſh; which is ſet forth together with another ſpeciall worke of God going before it, the ſending of Chriſt into the world to take fleſh, the nature of man on him; and that is further am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by one patticular end of his ſending, that it was for ſin. God ſending his owne Sonne in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh &amp; for ſin, condemned ſin in the fleſh. And here obſerue we in generall, that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which was impoſſible to the Law, that which the Law could not do, God found out a way, and he found out a meanes to effect and bring to paſſe. The Law could not bring to Gods choſen perfect holineſſe and purity, that was impoſſible to the Law: yet the Lord did effect and worke it by ſending his Sonne into the world, to be incarnate, and to take fleſh on him.

That is an idle fancy, and howſoeuer they pretend ſuch motions are from Gods Spirit, indeed they are from a ſpirit of vanitie and pride, and from the ſpirit of error and lyes, euen from the diuell. If a man would haue ſound comfort touching his office and function, he muſt looke that he be called and ſent of God, that God hath fitted him with gifts for that office, and that he hath bene deſigned to his office in a right manner, and that the Lord hath giuen him an heart to be faithfull, and to vſe his gifts for the beſt good. If he finds himſelfe ſo called and ſent, he may aſſure himſelfe of the Lords aſſiſtance in the execution of his office: yea of the Lords ſpeciall protection ouer him, that the Lord will ſhield and protect him againſt iniuries and wrongs, ſo farre as ſhall be for his owne glorie and his good, and that ſuch as do wrong him, ſhall be ſure to feele the reuenging hand of God on them or theirs: and howſoeuer he be little regarded amongſt men, yet his worke is with the Lord, Iſai. 40.4.<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.4.</note> and the Lord will one day of his mercy reward him.

               <p>Obſerue we further, the Apoſtle here calls Chriſt, <hi>Gods owne Sonne: God ſending his Sonne in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh:</hi> thereby he puts a difference betweene Chriſt and all other ſonnes of God,<note place="margin">How Chriſt is Gods owne Sonne.</note> as that Chriſt is the Sonne of God his Father in a peculiar manner, not by creation, as the Angels and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> were, nor by adoption, as all true beleeuers are, but by nature, euen by eternall generation, being begotten of the ſubſtance of his Father from all eternitie, his Father fully communicating to him his whole eſſence after an vnſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

For it is not here ſaid, that God ſent his Sonne in ſinfull fleſh, but <hi>in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh,</hi> like to ſinfull fleſh. The Sonne of God taking fleſh on him, did ſo farre abaſe himſelfe, as he appeared like a ſinfull man. And though our nature as Chriſt tooke it, was free from all ſpot and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of ſinne, yet was it not free from the effects and fruites of ſinne, it was ſubiect to thoſe common infirmities which ſinne brought on vs, euen to thoſe infirmities that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the whole nature of man, as to hunger, thirſt, cold, nakedneſſe, wearineſſe, to mortalitie, and death it ſelfe: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as thoſe that looked on Chriſt with a mortall eye, they could ſee nothing in him but that which appertaines to man, and they thought him to be nothing elſe but a meere man. Ioh. 6.52. <hi>The Iewes ſay, how can this man giue vs his fleſh to eate?</hi> Yea thoſe that looked on him with the eye of the body, they ſaw <hi>neither forme nor beautie in him to be deſired,</hi> Iſai. 53.2. Yea as the Prophet further addes, <hi>He was despiſed and reiected of men, he was full of ſorrowes, and had experience of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> Phil. 2.7. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He tooke on him the forme of a ſeruant, and was made like to men, and was found in the ſhape as a man.</hi> The meaning is, that Chriſt had the like naturall properties of a true body and ſoule, the like affections and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, without ſinne, that other men haue, and was in ſence and behauiour as other men are; yea he abaſed himſelfe,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:492:44"/> and was content to be made inferiour, not onely to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but to men of the meaneſt ſort and condition: he was ſold for thirtie peeces of ſiluer, he was thought not ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to liue as <hi>Barrabas</hi> the murtherer, he was ranked among theeues, when he hanged on the croſſe he was accounted of and handled as a moſt vile ſinner and wicked malefactor. All which prooue, both the truth of his manhood, and alſo his exceeding great abaſement. And the truth of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood may be further prooued by many euidences of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Rom. 1.3. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He was made of the ſeed of Dauid according to the fleſh.</hi> Gal. 4.4. <hi>When the fulneſſe of time was come, God ſent forth his Sonne made of a woman:</hi> which proues that he was truly man. And many like teſtimonies of Scripture might be brought to this purpoſe, if it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>

No, no, it cannot be: Chriſt being God and man in one perſon, he is a perfect Mediator; for he is a Mediator, both as he is God and as he is man. In his humane nature he performed the chiefe duties of a Mediator; and therefore the Apoſtle calls him, <hi>The Mediator betweene God and man, the man Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> 1. Tim. 2.5. And his workes of mediation are of infinite worth, and value, and ſufficiency, becauſe his manhood is perſonally vnited to his Godhead, and ſo he is a

And that is an excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtle here addes a particular end of Chriſt his taking fleſh on him, that it was for ſinne: and ſaith, <hi>God ſending his owne Sonne in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſin, condemned ſinne in the fleſh.</hi> That is, (as we ſhewed in opening the text) to take away, and to driue ſinne out of our nature, euen to expell the blot and ſtaine of nature, which did ſticke in our fleſh before Chriſt did aſſume and take our fleſh on him, to expell that blot and ſtaine vtterly out of that nature of ours which he tooke on him.</p>
               <p>Now here obſerue we, that for the aboliſhing of ſinne out of our nature, the Sonne of God muſt deſcend from heauen, and take fleſh on him, and become man, ſo hard a thing was it to expell and to driue ſinne out of our nature. The point hence offered is this.</p>

Pſal. 51.10. <hi>Dauid</hi> prayes, <hi>Lord create in me a cleane heart:</hi> and creating (we know) is a worke of Gods owne hand, and a worke of his hand alone. And ſo it muſt needs be granted, that the expelling and driuing of ſinne out of our nature but in part, is a moſt hard worke, and ſuch a worke, as it requires no leſſe then the mighty and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull hand of God to effect it: And why? the reaſons of it are theſe.</p>

               <p>Now here in the firſt place we might eaſily take vp this truth: That the Sonne of God taking fleſh on him, and being incarnate, did vtterly aboliſh ſinne and corruption out of that <label type="milestone">

And to this purpoſe is that of the Angell to the Virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> Luke 1.35. <hi>That holy thing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which ſhall be borne of thee, ſhall be called the Sonne of God.</hi> He calls Chriſt holy, or an holy thing, both becauſe as God he was moſt holy, and becauſe alſo as man, he was conceiued and borne free from all ſpot of ſinne, and was ſanctified in the wombe of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 1. Pet. 1.19. the Apoſtle deſcribing Chriſt, thus ſpeakes of him, that <hi>He was a lambe vndefiled, and without ſpot:</hi> and this was prefigured in the Paſchall lambe, which was to be <hi>without blemiſh,</hi> as the Lord commanded, Exod. 12.5. and in the lambes of the daily ſacrifice, Num. 28.3. The Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that thoſe lambes ſhould be without ſpot. Heb. 9.14. it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt offered himſelfe without ſpot to God:</hi> he offered himſelfe as man, (for ſo indeed did Chriſt offer himſelfe) without any ſpot or ſtaine of ſinne at all, ſo that in him our nature and the corruption of nature were ſeuered one from the other.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:492:49"/>
               <p>And the reaſons of it are theſe: firſt, in Chriſt our nature was <label type="milestone">

               <p>Againe, ſecondly, Chriſt was a Sauiour, as he is both God <label type="milestone">

And therefore doubtleſſe this is a certaine truth, that the Sonne of God taking fleſh and our nature on him, he did vtterly aboliſh ſinne and corruption out of that fleſh and humane nature that he tooke, and his fleſh and his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature was conceiued and borne without all ſpot of ſinne.

And therefore deceiue not thy ſelfe, do not imagine as many fooliſhly do, that thou art one with Chriſt, and that thou haſt part in the ſweet comforts in Chriſt, and yet the corruption of thy heart is as ſtrong and as powerfull in thee as euer it was, and it breakes out on euery occaſion: and if thou be but a little moued, thou powreſt out the bitterneſſe of thy ſoule, in curſing, in ſwearing, in railing, and the like: if thou ſo thinke, then doſt thou but deceiue thy ſelfe.

               <p>Againe, is it ſo that the Sonne of God taking our nature <label type="milestone">

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:492:53"/> the commandement is loue out of a pure heart.</hi> The Law of God requires the puritie of heart and ſoule, and that the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man be conformed to it in holineſſe and puritie, as well as his thoughts, words, and actions: and this is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on reaſon. The reaſons of it are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt the Law of God, as breathed out from the Spirit of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> God, is of perfect puritie and holineſſe, and it expreſſeth the mind and will of God touching all morall matters; and his will is moſt holy, pure, and heauenly, like to his moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Maieſtie, and it muſt needs require a proportionable pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. And</p>
               <p>Againe, the morall Law of God, for the nature of it, is all one with that originall puritie and holineſſe that was placed in man in his firſt creation, euen with the image of God ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in perfect holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, and therefore doubtleſſe it requires puritie of heart and ſoule, and that the very nature of man be conformed to it in holineſſe and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as well as his thoughts, intentions, words and actions.</p>
               <p>Now then, this truth ſerues to diſcouer to vs the abſolute <label type="milestone">

Euen the want of that holineſſe and puritie that ought to be in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, is againſt the Law of God, that requires holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and puritie of heart, and ſoule, and in the very nature of man.<note place="margin">An Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> And it is a groſſe and erronious conceit which ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſticall ſpirits hold, that the corruption of nature is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt Gods Law, nor in it ſelfe ſinne; and that God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs not any Law in our conception and birth.

The want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie to the Law of God in a mans conception and birth, and the want of originall holineſſe &amp; puritie, is againſt Gods Law: the Law of God requires conformitie to it, not onely
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:492:54"/> in mens actions, but in their nature, and the want of ſuch conformity is deadly and damnable in it ſelfe, and makes a man ſubiect and lyable to the curſe of the Law.</p>

And whereas they ſay, that by the grace of Chriſt men may fulfill the Law of God,<note place="margin">A propoſition not found in Gods booke.</note> we find not that propoſition in all the booke of God, neither can it be gathered from thence: indeed by the grace of Chriſt men are enabled to yeeld obedience to the Law of God in ſome meaſure, but not perfectly to fulfill it in the time of this life. The beſt and moſt holy that liue on the face of the earth, haue a corruption ſtill abiding in them, and they are not able in the time of this life in their owne perſons per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to keepe and fulfill the Law of God. And though true beleeuers cannot perfectly fulfill the Law of God in their owne perſons, in the time of this life, yet that will not follow that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> infers on it, that Chriſt obtained not that which he intended: for he can neuer proue that Chriſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any ſuch thing. When Chriſt ſatisfied the Law for the faithfull, his intent and purpoſe in fulfilling the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Law was, that true beleeuers might haue that righteouſneſſe of his imputed to them to their iuſtification.

               <p>In the next place obſerue we, that the Apoſtle here ſaith, that the righteouſneſſe of the Law might be fulfilled in vs, meaning that the righteouſneſſe of the Law might be fully accompliſhed in Chriſt as inherent in him, and in his perſon, and ſo in vs by imputation and application, we being mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, and one with him by faith, by the bond of his Spirit.

And this truth is not only grounded on this text, but in other places of Scripture. We haue further euidence and teſtimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the confirming of it. Rom. 5.19.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.19.</note> the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>by the obedience of one,</hi> meaning of Chriſt, <hi>many are made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi> Euen by the obedience of Chriſt, the obedience of his life and death, his perfect fulfilling of the Law of God, and by his ſuffering of death, as many as truly beleeue in him, are made as iuſt and righteous, as if they themſelues had done &amp; ſuffered the things that he did and ſuffered. Rom. 16.14. the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.4.</note> that <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to euery one that beleeueth:</hi> as if he had ſaid, Chriſt hath not onely determined and put an end to the ceremoniall Law of God, both for ſignification and promiſe, but he is alſo the end and perfection of the morall Law of God: he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly in his owne perſon accompliſhed the morall Law, and that not for himſelfe, but for righteouſneſſe to euery one that truly beleeues in him.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vr Apoſtle hauing in the verſe foregoing fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len againe on the qualification of the perſons to whom freedome from condemnation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, as that they are thus qualified: They walke not after the fleſh but after the Spirit, and made an oppoſition betweene thoſe two, to walke after
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:492:59"/> the fleſh and to walke after the Spirit, that true beleeuers walke not after the fleſh but after the Spirit; in theſe two verſes, 5.6. he further layes forth that contrariety. And firſt he ſhewes that there is a contrariety betweene thoſe that walke after the fleſh and thoſe that walke after the Spirit, in reſpect of their natures and diſpoſitions, that they are of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diſpoſitions and affections; and that is in the 5. verſe, as namely, they that walke after the fleſh, or they that are after the fleſh, for ſo ſpeakes the Apoſtle, they are thus diſpoſed, they ſauour the things of the fleſh: but on the other ſide, they that are after the Spirit, they are minded and diſpoſed to the contrary, they ſauour the things of the Spirit: and by this contrariety of diſpoſitions he proues, that true beleeuing iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied perſons walke not after the fleſh but after the Spirit. For (ſaith he) they that are after the fleſh, ſauour the things of the fleſh, but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. Then ſecondly, the Apoſtle ſhewes that there is a contrarietie betweene thoſe that walke after the fleſh &amp; thoſe that walke after the Spirit, in reſpect of their ends, that their ends are contrarie, verſe 6. I will lay forth that contrarietie when we come to the handling of that verſe. Now to keepe within the compaſſe of the 5. verſe, ſetting forth the contrarietie that is betweene them that are after the fleſh, and after the Spirit, in reſpect of their natures and diſpoſitions, the words of this verſe are firſt to be opened.</p>

And ſo the Apoſtles meaning in theſe words is this, they mind and affect the things of the fleſh, they muſe and meditate, and thinke of thoſe things, they affect them, and loue and like them, they care for them, and deſire them, and ſeeke after them, and thoſe things are ſweet, and ſauourie, &amp; pleaſing to them, and they well reliſh them.

And doubtleſſe thus it is with ſuch as are truly religious, it is euen irkſome and tedious to them to remaine among the wicked but for a time.

The godly and the wicked cannot conſort and company together with comfort and delight to them both: they are of contrarie mindes, and of contrary diſpoſitions, and that which is ſauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the one is vnſauorie to the other; good things are ſweete and pleaſing to the godly, and they delight to be ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them, but to the wicked they are harſh and vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and they ſit as on thornes when they heare them ſpoken of; and ſo carnall things are ſweete, ſauorie, and pleaſing to the wicked, and they commonly fome out filthineſſe, ribal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie, and rotten ſpeeches with delight, which if the godly heare, they heare with griefe and vexation to their ſoules: and with what comfort then can they conſort together?

And think not that thou canſt ſo handle the matter, as that thou maiſt be ſoundly religious, and yet be a familiar companion with wicked and prophane perſons, and that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily; no no, thou being familiar with the wicked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this that thou doſt thereby prouoke God to anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, as <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> did by ioyning with <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> 2.

               <p>Firſt this, Carnall things, the pleaſures of ſin, and the like, <label type="milestone">

So is it with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall perſons, carnall things are beſt pleaſing to them, and they finde moſt ſweetneſſe and ſauour in them, becauſe they are moſt agreeable to corrupt nature, and do moſt of all feed and nouriſh their naturall humour.</p>
               <p>Againe ſecondly, carnall perſons out of the blindneſſe of <label type="milestone">

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:492:63"/> and draw them from following after the things of the fleſh.

This then we may reſolue on as a certaine truth, that the things of the fleſh, the pleaſures of ſinne, riches, and the like, being moſt agreeable to the nature of carnall perſons, and they out of their blindneſſe of mind, placing their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the fruition of them, that thoſe things are moſt ſweet and ſauourie, and pleaſing to them, and that thoſe are the things they moſt mind and affect, they care for, and deſire, and ſeeke after, and take moſt delight and pleaſure in.</p>

The world thinkes Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fooliſh and mad, and ſticke not ſometimes ſo to ſay, that they are fooliſh and mad people, in that they ſo runne after Sermons, and are ſo eager in following after holy exerciſes; they iudge of Gods children by themſelues, and thinke that others find as little ſweetneſſe in holy things as they do: but alas they are deceiued, Gods children find an excellent taſte and ſweetneſſe in holy things, yea Gods children reliſhing and ſauouring the word of God and holy things to their comfort, they find ſuch ſweetneſſe and comfort in them, as they would not part withall for all the world. And holy things being ſauoured of Gods children, in their ſweetneſſe they giue to them a taſte and a beginning of that ioy that eye hath not ſeene, eare hath not heard, nor the heart of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: and therefore no maruell though they follow after them with ſuch earneſtneſſe &amp; eagerneſſe as they do.

Surely then it is no hard matter for a man or woman to diſcerne
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:492:67"/> whether they be in the ſtate of regeneration or no: whether they be truly regenerate or no; a man or a woman may eaſily deſcerne it, by the affection and ſauour they haue in reſpect of good things, as a man may eaſily diſcerne the ſtate of his body whether it be in health or diſtempered by his taſte. If his mouth be in good taſte, and do well reliſh good and wholeſome meate and drinke, he knowes that his body is in good temper: but if a mans mouth be out of taſte, and good and wholeſome meate and drinke is bitter and diſtaſtfull to him, and he cannot well reliſh them, he knowes by that, that ſome peccant and hurtfull humor troubles his ſtomacke, and that his body is diſtempered: So in this caſe, if a man find good things ſweet and ſauourie to him, and he doth well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them, he may thereby know, that there is ſome grace in his heart; but if good things be diſtaſtfull to him, and he finds not that ſweetneſſe that is to be found in them, he may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by know that his heart is not ſeaſoned with ſanctifying grace, but hath a corrupt humour, euen the corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſtill abounding in it.

Doſt thou come to the houſe of God, and to the publicke exerciſes of religion, with ioy and with much delight, and with chearefulneſſe as to a feaſt, as it is ſaid, Pſal. 42.4? Is it the ioy of thine heart to be exerciſed in hearing the word, in prayer, in ſinging of Pſalmes? And doſt thou thinke thy ſelfe neuer ſo well as when thou art ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in holy duties? Certainly then thou art regenetate, thou mayeſt thereby diſcerne that there is ſanctifying grace in thine heart. But if ſo be things heauenly and ſpirituall be harſh and vnpleaſant to thee, the Sabbath is a burden to thee, holy exerciſes are irkeſome and tedious to thee, thou comeſt (indeed) to publicke holy exerciſes, but it is ſlackly, for forme and faſhion, and in ſome ſiniſter and by reſpect, and in attending on the word thou art heauie and drouſie,

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Verſe our Apoſtle further ſhewes, that there is a contrarietie betweene thoſe that walke after the fleſh and thoſe that walke after the Spirit, in reſpect of their ends; that their ends are contrary one to the other, that the fruite and end of thoſe that are after the fleſh, and ſauour the things of the fleſh, and walke after the fleſh, is death: yea that the fruite and end of their wiſedome is death; for ſo the Apoſtle deliuers it, <hi>For the wiſedome of the fleſh is death:</hi> but on the other ſide, that the fruite or end of thoſe that are after the Spirit, and ſauour the things of the Spirit, and walke after the Spirit, is twofold, and both comfortable, namely, life and peace. <hi>The wiſedome of the fleſh is death, but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the wiſedome of the Spirit is life and peace.</hi> And ſo we haue the generall matter of this verſe. I will ſtand a while to cleare the ſence and meaning of the words of it. <hi>For the wiſedome of the fleſh is death.</hi> The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>(for)</hi> is not here to be taken as a note of a reaſon prouing that which goes before,<note place="margin">Interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> but as implying an exhortation, as if the Apoſtle had ſubioyned, Let vs not ſauour the things of the fleſh, for the wiſedome of it is death; and ſo it is a note
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:492:68"/> of an argument diſſwading from ſauouring the things of the fleſh. <hi>Wiſedome of the fleſh.</hi> By <hi>fleſh</hi> we are to vnderſtand the corruption of nature, or corrupt nature, euen the ſame which the Apoſtle meanes, Galat. 5.24. where he ſaith, <hi>They that are Christs haue crucified the fleſh:</hi> that is, the corruption of nature, or their corrupt nature. And the word here rendred <hi>wiſedome,</hi> comes from that word that is vſed verſe before tranſlated <hi>ſauour:</hi> which word (as I ſhewed) ſignifies to mind, or to affect, comprehending vnder it the actions and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mind, and of the will and affections: and ſo the originall word here vſed, ſignifies the act of the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and will, minding, willing or affecting, and may be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently tranſlated, wiſedome, ſence, affection, deſire: the new tranſlators render it, to be minded. And verſe 27. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>He that ſearcheth the hearts, knoweth the mind or meaning of the ſpirit,</hi> or what the ſpirit willeth: and the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall word is there the very ſame that here is vſed, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So that thus much is comprehended vnder the word here v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, The minding, meaning, the thoughts, diſcourſes, purpoſes, and counſels, the loue and liking, the care, the deſire and delight, the ſtudy and beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of corrupt nature, the wiſedome of it <hi>is death,</hi> that is, is deadly, or cauſeth death, or brings vnto death, the fruite or end of it is death. Now <hi>death</hi> being here put metonymically, by <hi>death</hi> we are to vnderſtand death of body and death of ſoule, death temporall and death eternall, euen the wrath of God and euerlaſting deſtruction. <hi>But the wiſedome of the Spirit.</hi> Theſe wordes ſtand in oppoſition to the wiſedome of the fleſh, and the meaning of them is briefly this, The minding, meaning, the thoughts, purpoſes, diſcourſes, and counſels, the wiſedome, the loue and liking, the care and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of renewed nature, of nature renewed and ſanctified by the Spirit of grace, <hi>is life and peace:</hi> that is, it brings to life and peace, the fruits or ends of it are life and peace. And by <hi>life,</hi> we are to vnderſtand eternall life and ſaluation: and by <hi>peace,</hi> true peace and comfort of conſcience in this life, and eternall peace and comfort in the life to come. <hi>But the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:492:69"/> of the Spirit.</hi> The minding and affecting of renewed and ſanctified nature, brings to eternall life and happineſſe: not as a meritorious, but as <hi>cauſa ſine qua non;</hi> as a meanes or a way which God hath ordained for his choſen to walke in to life and ſaluation, as Epheſ. 2.10. <hi>God hath ordained good works, that we ſhould walke in them,</hi> as in a way leading to eternall life and happineſſe. Thus then briefly conceiue we the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apoſtle in the wordes of this verſe, as if he had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The minding, the meaning, the thoughts, diſcourſes, purpoſes, counſels, and in a word, the ſtudy, and the best act and exerciſe of corrupt nature, the wiſedome of it is deadly and brings to death; the fruite and end of it is death of body and death of ſoule, death temporall and death eternall, euen the wrath of God and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting perdition. And on the other ſide, the minding, willing, and affecting, the ſtudie and exerciſe of renewed nature that as a way, brings to eternall life and happineſſe, to true peace and comfort of conſcience in this life, and to eternall peace and euerlasting comfort in the life to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now thus vnderſtanding the words, obſerue we, that as the Apoſtle in the verſe before made an oppoſition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie betweene ſuch as be after the fleſh and ſuch as be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Spirit, in reſpect of their nature and diſpoſitions; here in this verſe he makes an oppoſition betweene them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their ends, that their ends are contrarie one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that the end of thoſe that are after the fleſh, and ſauour the things of the fleſh, and follow the guidance of the fleſh, in the wiſedome of the fleſh, is death: and the fruite and end of thoſe that are after the Spirit, and follow the guidance of the Spirit, in the wiſedome of the Spirit, is life and peace. <label type="milestone">

What a madneſſe were it for any ſo to thinke? Such is the folly and madneſſe of thoſe that go on in the wayes of the fleſh, and follow after

Poore ſoules, the diuell blinds them; and this is one of the ſubtilties of Satan, in good things he ſeuers the meanes from the end, he perſwades a man that he may come to the end though he neuer vſe the meanes, that a man may come to life and ſaluation, though he neuer ſet foote in the way that leades thither. Oh take heed of this ſubtiltie, and this deceit of Satan, and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it whoſoeuer thou art, that the regenerate and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate cannot poſſibly meete together in their ends: and know that if thou be after the fleſh, a carnall perſon, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoring the things of the fleſh, and followeſt after the luſts of the fleſh in reſpect of the profits and pleaſures of the world, thou art going on in the way that leades to deſtruction; and holding on thy courſe in that way, thou canſt not poſſibly meet with the peace, and comfort, and happineſſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a child of God, either in this life or in that life that is to come.</p>
               <p>Now more particularly in the next place, in that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here ſaith, <hi>That the wiſedome of the fleſh is death,</hi> he points out what the beſt act of the ſoule of a carnall man or woman, yea what the beſt act of corrupt nature brings forth, and what it makes a man or a woman liable and ſubiect to.

Alas, their pregnancy of wit, and their deepe reaching heads, are but inſtruments and meanes of their greater woe and ſorrow, ſo long as they continue in their carnall ſtate and in their naturall condition.

If then God haue giuen thee an excellent wit, and other excellent parts and gifts of mind, be not proud or highly conceited of them, but labour thou to haue them ſanctified; for certainly if they be not ſanctified, they are moſt dangerous and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to thine owne ſoule: yea the more pregnant thy wit is, the more excellent the gifts of thy mind are, the fitter inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are they for Satan to worke by, euen thine owne woe and thine owne euerlaſting deſtruction.

No maruell then though carnall perſons do ſo diſdaine the holy courſe of Gods children, and thinke ſo baſely of it as commonly they do; and that they eſteeme of Gods children as fooles, and ſticke not to terme and to call them fooles, and to ſay they are preciſe fooles: as <hi>Michal</hi> ſaid of <hi>Dauid.</hi> 2. Sam. 6.20. when he danced before the Lord, that he was but a foole or vaine fellow. For why, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall perſons, ſuch as are wiſe after the fleſh, they iudge of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:492:72"/> Gods children by their fleſhly wiſedome, and that tels them they are but ſilly fooles, and that they haue no wit nor wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in them: but on the other ſide, Gods children being guided by the light of true wiſedome, by the wiſedome of the Spirit, are able to winde and turne them, and to looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their very inwards: and they ſee and diſcerne that there is no dram of true wiſedome in carnall perſons: howſoeuer they be renowned and magnified for their wiſedome in the world, and held to be iolly wiſe men, yet Gods children diſcerne them to be but ſtarke fooles. And though carnall perſons bleſſe themſelues in their courſe, in that they are wiſe for the world, and for worldly matters, and they take a courſe to thriue in the world, and hold the courſe of Gods children to be follie and midneſſe, and no thriuing courſe, yet Gods children in the wiſedome of the Spirit, ſee and diſcerne them to be in a miſerable ſtate and condition, and they would not change ſtates with them for all the world. And ſo ſtands the caſe betweene ſuch as are carnally wiſe, and ſuch as haue in them the wiſedome of the Spirit. Now touching the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Spirit, the Apoſtle here oppoſeth that to the wiſedome of the fleſh, and he ſaith: that the fruites of that are life, and peace.

               <p>One thing note we further: the Apoſtle here doth appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate peace to the wiſedome of the Spirit; he makes true peace and ſound comfort the proper fruite of ſpirituall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yea a fruite that comes onely from that roote.

He affirmes verſe 6. that <hi>the wiſedome of the fleſh is death,</hi> or deadly and damnable; and here he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes it by this, that it is in flat oppoſition to God, yea that <hi>it is enimitie againſt God.</hi> The wiſedome of the fleſh is death, becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>it is enimitie againſt God.</hi> And that he might
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:492:78"/> not ſeeme to charge this on the wiſedome of the fleſh vniuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to lay this foule blot on it without cauſe or ground, he further proues it ſo to be. He proues the wiſedome of the fleſh to be enimitie againſt God, from the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per qualitie of an enemie: as namely, that it is thus qualified, that it is ſtiffe, and ſtubburne, and rebellious againſt God; which is deliuered in the proofe of it, that it doth not bow and bend to the will of God, <hi>it is not ſubiect to his Law:</hi> for ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.8.</note> 
                  <hi>It is not ſubiect to the Law of God.</hi> And he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amplifies that rebellion of the wiſedome of the fleſh, by denying all power to it to be ſubiect to Gods Law: he ſaith, <hi>it cannot be ſubiect,</hi> it hath no power in it ſelfe of being ſubiect to it: affirming that as a certaine truth, he ſaith, <hi>It is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> And then on theſe grounds he inferres this corrolarie or concluſion, verſe 8. that therefore <hi>they that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God.

                  </gap> comprehends vnder it the act and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe both of the mind and of the will.

So that by the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:492:78"/> wiſedome of the fleſh (as before we did expound it) we are to vnderſtand the meaning, thought, diſcourſe, ſet purpoſe, counſell, loue, liking, care, deſire, delight, ſtudie, the beſt act and exerciſe of corrupt nature, the wiſedome of it <hi>is eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie against God.</hi> The Apoſtle here ſpeakes verie emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, he vſeth a word of great force and vehemencie, he ſpeakes in the abſtract: he ſaith not,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>The wiſedome of the fleſh</hi> is an enemie, but <hi>it is enimitie againſt God,</hi> thereby ſignifying that it is extremely hoſtile, oppoſite, and contrary to God and to all goodneſſe, and it is carried againſt the very nature of God, ſo as if it could, it would take away the very being of God: yea that it is carried againſt God and all goodneſſe, with an vnreconcileable hatred and oppoſition: for an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie may be reconciled, as <hi>Eſau</hi> was to <hi>Iacob,</hi> but enimitie can neuer be reconciled; enimitie and amitie can neuer be at one. And therefore the Apoſtle affirming this of the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the fleſh, that <hi>it is enimitie againſt God,</hi> he would haue vs to know, that there can be no friendſhip betweene it and God, nor any agreement betweene it and goodneſſe, but that there is an vnreconcileable hatred and oppoſition betweene them. <hi>For it is not ſubiect to the Law of God.</hi> By the Law of God, we are to vnderſtand the morall Law of God, for the will of God reuealed in his word touching all morall duties, touching all duties of pietie towards God, and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching duties of loue, mercie, equitie, and iuſtice towards men. And the word here rendred <hi>ſubiect,</hi> ſignifies an orderly ſubiection, ſubiect according vnto order. It is the ſame that is vſed, Rom. 13.1. <hi>Let euery ſoule be ſubiect vnto the higher powers:</hi> or it ſignifies ſubmitting of the necke to the yoke. And the Apoſtle ſaying, the wiſedome of the fleſh is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, his meaning is, it yeelds not to it orderly ſubiection, it may haply hit on a good dutie commanded in the Law of God, but it doth it not orderly: yea the leſſe is ſpoken, and the more ſignified, it pulls as it were the necke from vnder that yoke, and it doth rebell and riſe vp againſt that Law; it vnderſtands, loues, and likes, and it doth things that the Law of God forbids, and it hates and auoyds the things that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:492:79"/> the Law of God commands. <hi>Neither indeed can be:</hi> or thus, <hi>for indeed it cannot be.</hi> That is, the wiſedome of the fleſh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſubiect to the Law of God: it hath no power nor abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in it ſelfe to yeeld obedience to Gods Law. Nay ſo long as it is the wiſedome of the fleſh, it cannot but rebell againſt the Law of God, according to that, Geneſ. 6.5. <hi>All the imaginations of the thoughts of his heart are onely euill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally:</hi> and that of the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 2.14. <hi>The naturall man perceiueth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto him; neither can he know them.</hi> He neither doth know them, neither hath he knowne them. Thus then briefly conceiue we the meaning of the Apoſtle in the words of this verſe, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe the mind, meaning, thought, diſcourſe, counſell, loue, liking, care, deſire, delight, ſtudie, beſt act and exerciſe of corrupt nature, the wiſedome of it is directly and extremely oppoſite and contrarie to God and to all goodneſſe, and is carried againſt God and all goodneſſe, with an vnreconcileable hatred and oppoſition. For why, it yeelds not to the Law of God, or will of God reuealed in his word any orderly ſubiection. No it puts as it were the very necke from the yoake: yea it doth rebell and riſe vp againſt the Law of God; it vnderſtands, it loues, likes, and it doth things that the Law of God forbids: and it hates and auoyds the things the Law of God commands; for indeed it hath no power, no abilitie in it ſelfe to yeeld obedience to the Law of God: nay ſo long as it remaines to be the wiſedome of the fleſh, it cannot but rebell againſt the Law of God.</hi>

               <p>Now here firſt marke we the Apoſtles reaſon, by which he prooues the wiſedome of the fleſh to be deadly and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: he prooues it to be deadly and damnable by this, that it is <hi>enimitie againſt God.</hi> He reaſons thus.

Conſider this who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou art that doſt oppoſe and ſet thy ſelfe againſt Gods children, thou doſt therein fight againſt God, thou ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt hands with the diuell; and going on in that courſe, thou doſt but worke thine owne wo, and bring confuſion on thy ſelfe; the Lord will ſtand vp for the defence of his children, and <hi>ſtirre vp himſelfe as a man of warre againſt thee,</hi> Iſay 42.13. and he will haue the victory: though thou take away the liues of his children, thou ſhalt not preuaile to their hurt, but thou ſhalt bring wo and confuſion to thy ſelfe. And this may be a great comfort to Gods children, to conſider that the Lord is an enemie to their enemies, and to thoſe that oppoſe them: they may be ſure their enemies ſhall neuer preuaile againſt them to their hurt, but in oppoſing them, they fight againſt God, and the Lord will bring confuſion on them. Let this be thought on, to the terror of all the enemies of Gods Church and children, and to the comfort of all ſuch as are the children of God.</p>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:492:87"/> of all holineſſe and righteouſneſſe: and ſo it muſt needs be euill and ſinfull. For indeed whatſoeuer act of the ſoule of man is not conſonant and agreeable to the Law of God, that is euill, and that is ſinfull. Sinne is ſo defined. 1. Ioh. 3.4. <hi>Sinne is tranſgreſſion of the Law:</hi> any act of man tranſgreſſing Gods Law, yea any act not agreeable to the Law of God, it is euill and ſinfull.

Now the truth deliuered makes ſtrongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that. For why: Is the beſt act and exerciſe of the ſoule of a corrupt perſon euill and ſinfull, euen his wiſedome, is that euill, becauſe it is not ſubiect to the Law of God? ſurely then the motions of the mind diſordered, the motions and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings that are in the mind and heart of man to euill, though conſent of will be not gained, though they neuer get conſent of will for the accompliſhment of euill, yet thoſe verie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt needs be euill and ſinfull. For certainly they are not ſubiect to the Law of God, they are repugnant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the Law of God, they are fruits of corruption; they are ſuch as men ſhould not haue had, if our firſt parents had ſtood and continued in the ſtate of innocencie: and therefore they are naught, and they are ſinnes, and it is a groſſe error to hold the contrarie.</p>
               <p>Now further in that the Apoſtle ſaith, the wiſedome of the fleſh is not ſubiect to the Law of God, neither indeed can be: affirming that as a certaine truth, <hi>neither indeed can be,</hi> we are giuen to vnderſtand thus much:</p>

And this is a thing that deceiues many in the world; they fancie to themſelues that faith is in their owne power, and that they can at their owne time and pleaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Chriſt. And herein the diuell deludes thouſands: yea ſome are ſo beſotted and blinded by the ſubtiltie of Satan, as they thinke they haue beleeued in Chriſt euer ſince they could remember, and they neuer doubted of Gods mercy. Or if this ſlight be too palpable and be diſcerned, yet Satan perſwades with them, they may beleeue when they will, and that it is an eaſie matter to beleeue in Chriſt, and in their
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:492:89"/> owne power to beleeue when they liſt; yea that they may take hold of the mercy of God and merit of Chriſt at the very laſt houre of their life: and with this pleaſing conceit he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thouſands to the pit of euerlaſting perdition. We are to take heed of this, and know that true faith in Chriſt is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull and ſupernaturall gift and grace of God, wrought by the exceeding greatneſſe of Gods power, euen by the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his almighty power,</hi> Ehpeſ. 1.19. and therefore not in any mans power to beleeue when he lift. <hi>No, no,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>if true faith in Chriſt were in a mans owne power, then would neuer any man fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the weight and burden of his ſinnes, and apprehending Gods anger and wrath againſt him for them, deſpaire of Gods mercy, but he would take hold of it to his comfort.</hi> Now wofull experience ſheweth the contrarie; that at ſuch a time as ſome are brought to the ſight of their ſinnes, and haue an apprehenſion and feeling of Gods anger againſt them for the ſame, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take hold of Gods mercy: no, they cannot be perſwaded by any meanes to take hold of it to their comfort; they rather blaſpheme God, and fall to vtter deſperation: and therefore it is not in mans power to beleeue when he liſt, and at his owne time and pleaſure. And if thou whoſoeuer thou art, pleaſe thy ſelfe in that conceit, that it is an eaſie matter to beleeue in Chriſt, and that thou maiſt ſo do when thou wilt, thou maiſt haply when the Lord lets thee ſee the greatneſſe of thy ſinnes, what thou haſt deſerued by them, ſeeke for faith and neuer finde it: yea, it may be, if thou wouldſt giue a thouſand worlds (if they were thine to giue) thou ſhalt not be able to find any comfort in Chriſt. And therefore take heed thou deceiue not thy ſelfe, learne to know, that true faith in Chriſt is not in a mans owne power, but is the onely worke of Gods mighty power: &amp; neuer reſt till thou find that the Lord hath wrought in thee the wonderfull and ſupernaturall worke of faith, euen ſuch a faith as is able to breake thorow the ſenſe and feeling of thine owne ſins and Gods anger, and to take hold of Gods mercie and merit of Chriſt, to thy comfort; and then thou maiſt be ſure that thou haſt ſuch a faith as is wrought in thee by the mightie and powerfull worke of Gods Spirit.</p>

                  </note>To be in the fleſh, is ſometimes taken in Scripture to be in a good ſenſe: it is all one with this, to be in the body, as Gal. 2.20.<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>In that I now liue in the fleſh.</hi> But the phraſe is not ſo to be taken in this place: it was the error of the Maniches, by <hi>fleſh</hi> in this place to vnderſtand the body. The phraſe is here vſed in the euill part, it is oppoſed to that, to be in the Spirit, as the Apoſtle ſaith in the next verſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye are not in the fleſh, but in the Spirit:</hi> and it is to be taken in a contrary ſence, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus, to be in the dregges and filth of nature, to be vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.5.</note> as we may gather from verſe 5. of Chapter 7. where the Apoſtle vſeth this phraſe, and ſaith, <hi>When we were in the fleſh, the motions of ſinnes which were by the Law, had force in our members, to bring forth fruite vnto death.</hi> It was the conceit of a Pope of Rome whom the Papiſts do magnifie, and ſay that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:492:90"/> men are to ſeeke the ſence and meaning of Scripture out of his breaſt. I ſay it was the conceit of one, Pope <hi>Syricius</hi> by name, that to be in the fleſh, in this place is to be vnderſtood of married perſons, of ſuch as liue in the married eſtate, that they are in the fleſh, and ſo cannot pleaſe God: directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the plaine text of the Apoſtle, who ſaith, that the Romanes to whom he writ, among whom were <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> and no doubt many other married perſons, that they were not in the fleſh, but in the Spirit. It is a ſtrange thing that the Papiſts ſhould ſo forget themſelues, as ſometimes to extoll marriage and to make it an holy Sacrament, and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times ſo to debaſe it, as to make it a ſtate and condition of life carnall, impure, and vncleane. This were ſtrange, but that indeed we are to conſider that they are poſſeſt with a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of blindneſſe and giddineſſe: but that by the way. The meaning of the phraſe is (as before we ſhewed) to be in the puddle and dregs of nature, to be vnregenerate. <hi>Cannot pleaſe God:</hi> that is, cannot thinke, ſpeake, or do any thing that God may like of, and to approue and account as pleaſing to him, and as it were take pleaſure in, as the Lord ſaith, Malac. 1.10.<note place="margin">Malac. 1.10.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue no pleaſure in you, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</hi> So the meaning of the Apoſtle in this verſe is briefly this, as if he had ſaid:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So then, or ſo therefore, they that are in their naturall ſtate and condition, in the dregs and filthy puddle of nature, &amp; as yet vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, they cannot poſſibly thinke, ſpeake, or do, any thing that God may like of, and approue of, and that he may accept as pleaſing to his holy Maieſtie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt note we here,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that this verſe is a concluſion inferred by the Apoſtle on the verſe foregoing, that ſeeing it is ſo that the wiſedome of the fleſh is enimitie againſt God, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is nor can be ſubiect to the Law of God: therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, being guided by the Spirit of God, <hi>They that are in the fleſh, they cannot pleaſe God.</hi> We ſee that this verſe is Gods truth, Gods owne concluſion, brought in on his owne premiſes in expreſſe termes, that they that are in the fleſh, they that are vnregenerate, they can do nothing pleaſing God. If
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:492:91"/> this had bene our concluſion deduced and drawne by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent out of ſome place of Scripture, the Papiſts might haue had ſome better colour,<note place="margin">Gods owne concluſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the merit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruitie.</note> though no good ground to except againſt it; but this we ſee is Gods owne truth, his owne concluſion grounded on his owne premiſes: they that are in the fleſh, as yet vnregenerate, they cannot pleaſe God. This beares ſtrongly againſt the merit of congruitie: in that the Papiſts ſay, a man in his naturall ſtate and condition may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelfe to receiue grace; yea that he may ſo fit himſelfe for grace, as that he merits grace at the hands of God <hi>ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruo,</hi> by a kind of congruitie, they directly thwart, and croſſe, and contradict Gods owne truth, and his own concluſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on his owne premiſes: namely, that they that are in the fleſh are ſo farre from meriting, as they can do nothing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God. And no maruell though the Papiſts ſeeke to peruert this text, and to thruſt on it a miſconſtruction, and falſe interpretation, becauſe it makes ſo directly againſt them, and in ſuch expreſſe termes deliuered by the Apoſtle from the mouth of Gow himſelfe, and by the ſpeciall <hi>motion of the holy Ghoſt:</hi> as 2. Pet. 1.21. This I thought good to note, to ſhew by what ſpirit the Papiſts are led, euen by a lying ſpirit, a ſpirit in flat oppoſition and contradiction to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.</p>
               <p>Now in the next place obſerue, how the Apoſtle doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the ſtate and condition of ſuch as are in the dregs of nature, as yet vnregenerate. He ſaith, they are in the fleſh; he ſaith not there is fleſh and corruption in them, for that may be, and is in the beſt of Gods children ſo long as they liue in the world: but they are in the fleſh; this phraſe is verie weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and verie ſignificant, it imports an vniuerſal thraldome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſinne and corruption.

Such is the rich goodneſſe of our good and gracious God, as that of his abundant mercy he is pleaſed ſometimes to giue outward bleſſings euen to ciuill obedience, and outward good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of vnbeleeuers, and ſuch as are yet in the ſtate of nature, to incourage his children to yeeld obedience to him with greater chearfulneſſe.

The chiefe thing that a man ſhould endeuour and ſeek for, is how to pleaſe God, and to be approued of him on whom depends his being, his life, and all his comfort, both in life and death, and for euer. Now this cannot a man do that is yet in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſtate and condition: no, know it whoſoeuer thou art,

Yea, to paſſe by them, many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our ſelues deceiue themſelues in this reſpect, they thinke they do things highly well pleaſing to God, &amp; ſuch as he doth greatly like and approue of, when in deed &amp; in truth there is no ſuch matter. For example, do not many imagine and thinke that their true and iuſt dealing with men, their gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing euery man his owne, their hearing the word of God, their praying, and the like things done by them, are things exceeding well pleaſing to the Lord, and that he likes them, and approues of them maruellous well, though thoſe things as they are done by them come not from a ſanctified heart, not from the roote of a ſound iuſtifying faith, they are yet in the dregs of nature, and as yet in their naturall ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: do not many thus thinke? without queſtion they do, and becauſe they do ſuch things, they thinke they are greatly in Gods fauour. Indeed it is true, it cannot be denied, but that ſuch things for the ſubſtance of them, and conſidered in themſelues, and by themſelues, are good things, and ſuch as God hath commanded to be done: but yet know whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou art, if thou be an vnregenerate perſon, and as yet in thy naturall ſtate and condition, euen the beſt things that can be, being done by thee, they are diſpleaſing to God, they come not from the roote of true faith purging thy heart from corruption, without which it is not poſſible to pleaſe God, Hebr 11.6. And therefore do not thou gather and conclude, that God is well pleaſed with the good things thou doſt, onely becauſe the things done by thee are good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: if thou ſo do, thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe, thou gathereſt Gods good liking and his approbation by a falſe ground onely from thine owne fancy: and the diuell and thine owne corrupt heart deceiue thee, thou muſt find thy ſelfe regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,

Haply ſome will ſay, Gods choſen, his elect, are beloued of God being yet in their naturall ſtate and condition, for Gods loue is eſſentiall in God, and of the ſame nature with himſelfe; and thoſe whom he hath loued from all eternitie, and of his meere loue elected and appointed to life and ſaluation, them he doth embrace in his loue at all times, euen when they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, and as yet in their naturall ſtate and condition: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may ſeeme that their perſons and their workes are pleaſing to God though they be yet vnregenerate, and as yet in their naturall ſtate and condition. <label type="milestone">

                  </label> For anſwer to this, we muſt know, that there be different degrees of Gods loue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended towards his choſen; Gods loue in it ſelfe admits nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor leſſe, it is all one, but as it is extended and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out towards Gods choſen,<note place="margin">A diſtinction needfull to be knowne and conſidered.</note> there be different degrees of it: for Gods elect are loued of God before their calling, as the elect of God onely knowne to God ſo to be, (for he onely knowes them to belong to his election in time to be called) with that degree of loue that is proper to his elect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called; but when they are called and iuſtified, then they are loued of God with a further degree of his loue, euen to an actuall acceptation and liking of their perſons, and good things done by them as pleaſing to him in Chriſt. So that ſtill it remaines a truth, that if thou wouldſt be actually accepted of the Lord, thinke, ſpeake, and do, the things pleaſing to his holy Maieſtie, thou muſt find thy ſelfe regenerate, and ſet out of thy naturall ſtate and condition, and that thy perſon is actually accepted of God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Obſerue yet further, the Apoſtle ſaith, They that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God. He ſpeaks here of pleaſing God, not of meriting or deſeruing any good at the hands of God; we find not that affirmed in any place of the booke of God, of the beſt and moſt holy obedience of Gods children, that it merits or deſerues any good at the hands of God. This we
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:492:94"/> often find affirmed in Scripture of the obedience of Gods children, that it is acceptable to God, &amp; that the good things done by them are accepted and pleaſing to God through Chriſt: but neuer do we find it ſaid of the obedience of Gods children, that it merits or deſerues any good at the hands of God. No, it cannot be gathered out of any place of Scripture by any good conſequent, that the holy obedience of Gods children and the good things done by them, do merit or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue any good at Gods hands. So that on this ground, thus comparing this text with other places of Scripture, we may gather and conclude thus much.</p>

And therfore it is a bold and a monſtrous preſumption in any whatſoeuer they be, that take on them to diſcerne of ſome particular perſons, that they are reprobates, and ſuch as ſhall certainly be damned. Indeed we may ſafely ſay of wicked and prophane perſons, and ſuch as hold on a courſe in ſinne, that they are in a damnable caſe and ſtate, and that if they go on in that ſtate, they are ſure to go to hell: but certainly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of their finall ſtate, that is more then any man can do. Some phantaſticke ſpirits take on them by looking on mens faces to diue into their hearts, and then to pronounce them hypocrites and vnregenerate, and ſuch as haue not repented of their ſinnes. Though they haue no iuſt cauſe otherwiſe to iudge of them, but that they are religious, and ſuch as feare God, yet they ſay they can tell by looking on their faces, that they are hypocrites and vnregenerate. An idle, fooliſh, and wicked conceit; we are but men of ordinarie gifts, we haue not that extraordinarie ſpirit of diſcerning that the holy Prophets and Apoſtles had. And if we ſee men outwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and reſembling Gods children, that they carrie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as the children of God, (they may deceiue vs indeed) but if they ſo carrie themſelues, we are to iudge of them cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably, and in the iudgement of charitie to hold them to be in the number of Chriſtians: and they that otherwiſe iudge, <hi>they know not of what ſpirit they are,</hi> as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> Luke 9.55. they are carried with a lying and a

               <p>Now here further obſerue we, that the Apoſtle being gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Spirit of God, affirming of the beleeuing Romans that they were not in the fleſh but in the Spirit: that they were in the Spirit: without queſtion the very beſt amongſt the beleeuing Romans had fleſh and corruption ſtill in part abiding in them, and yet the Apoſtle counts them holy and regenerate, and in the Spirit: and his eſtimation and account of them was Gods account, the Lord did ſo eſteeme and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them; for the Apoſtle ſpake as he was moued by the holy Ghoſt.

               <p>The Lord is ſo good and ſo gracious to his children, <label type="milestone">

And hence it is that the Apoſtle

               </p>
               <p>In theſe words the Apoſtle giues them a watch-word, to looke to it that none of them did aſſume and take that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to them that did not belong to them, but that they ſhould ſee to it that they haue the Spirit of God dwelling in them indeed: affirming this, that <hi>if any man haue not the Spirit
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:492:109"/> of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his.</hi> And herein appeares the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly wiſedome of the Apoſtle; he ſo applies the word of comfort to the Romans, to whom he writ, as withall he giues them a caueat and watch-word, to take heed they did not hale comfort to them which did not belong to them, but that they ſhould looke to the ground of their comfort. And this ought to be the wiſedome of all good Miniſters, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they ſpeake to a mixt companie: they are then ſo to order and to temper their words of comfort, as that none may abuſe them, or miſapplie them. In ſpeaking and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word of comfort to Gods children, which properly belongs to them, they are to take heed they lift not vp the hearts of the wicked and prophane, but withall they are to giue them an item and a watch-word, that they preſume not to lay foule and theeuiſh hands on that comfort, and hale and pull that vnto them which they haue no right to. But to paſſe by this, come we to the caueat or watch-word it ſelfe: <hi>But if any man haue not the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame is not his.</hi> And here firſt marke and obſerue we the generalitie of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſpeech: he ſaith, If any man whatſoeuer he be, he ſpeakes without exception, if any man, as if he had ſaid, Let a man be what he will, or be a man what he may be, rich or poore, high or low, noble or baſe, learned or vnlearned, and let him haue neuer ſo excellent gifts and endowments of body or mind, inward or outward, it skils not, it is nothing to his comfort, he cannot thereupon conclude that his ſtate is good if he want grace and holineſſe. <hi>If any man haue not the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame is not his:</hi> he belongs not to him, he is not in the comfortable ſtate of a true Chriſtian.

Therefore reſt not thou in anything but onely in this, that thou haſt the Spirit of Chriſt, and that the Spirit of Chriſt is in thee by his true powerfull working preſence, and by the efficacie and power of his grace; that indeed will yeeld thee this comfort, that thou belongeſt to Chriſt, and art a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt, and a true Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>There is yet one thing further to be noted from this verſe. The Apoſtle here (as we ſee) cals the holy Ghoſt the holy Spirit of God the Spirit of Chriſt alſo: becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>the Spirit of God dwelleth in you:</hi> and then he ſubioynes, <hi>But if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ.</hi> Now in that he cals the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God the Spirit of Chriſt, it proues clearly and ſtrongly,

And what is it that Chriſt hath taught vs by his Spirit? Surely nothing but that which is recorded in the written word of God, and made knowne by the miniſterie of the Prophets and Apoſtles. And all doctrines concerning ſaluation that are beſides or contrarie to the written word of God, as moſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh doctrines be; they are not reuealed by the Spirit of God, but are meere fictions and deuices of the diuell. And it is an
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:492:114"/> idle and fooliſh thing of the Anabaptiſts and of the Familiſts to depend on reuelations of the Spirit beſides the written word of God, they bragging much of the illumination of the Spirit. Surely thoſe reuelations they brag of beſides the written word of God, are not ſuggeſted to them by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, but by the ſpirit of error, euen by the diuell. That which Chriſt doth ſuggeſt by his Spitit to Gods children, it is that doctrine that is either expreſſed in the written word of God, or that which is agreeable to it. Ioh. 14.26. Chriſt promiſeth that his Spirit ſhould <hi>ſuggeſt and bring all things to the minds of his diſciples:</hi> and he addes, <hi>which he had told them,</hi> and taught them, and not any new doctrines and reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Againe, he ſaith Ioh. 16.14. <hi>He ſhall receiue of mine, and ſhall ſhew it to you.</hi> And hence it is that the Apoſtle cals his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>the miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2.

Verſe he comes to make knowne to them the other part of their freedome, that is, from death: and in the 10. and 11. verſes, he ſhewes them to their comfort how farre they were freed from death. In this 10. verſe, that they were freed from death ſo farre as that they were ſubiect to it but in part, onely in reſpect of the bodie, not in reſpect of the ſoule. Then verſe 11. that they were ſubiect to death in their bodies but for a time, that their bodies being mortall, yea being dead, they ſhould not euer remaine vnder the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of death, but they ſhould in time be quickened and raiſed vp againe from death to life. That is the ſumme and ſubſtance of theſe two verſes: containing in them this ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that true beleeuers are not ſubiect to death, either wholly or perpetually.</p>
               <p>Now in this 10. verſe, the Apoſtle ſpeakes to the comfort of the beleeuing Romans by way of preuention of a ſecret obiection For, haply they might obiect and ſay to him, You tell vs that we are not in the fleſh but in the Spirit, and that the Spirit of God dwels in vs, and that ſo we are in Chriſt, but yet you ſee it, and we find it, that are ſubiect to death as well as others, and death is the fruite and effect of ſinne,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:492:115"/> and therefore what may we thinke of our ſelues: haue we ſuch ground of comfort in our ſelues as you ſeeme to yeeld to vs? To this the Apoſtle anſwers, granting to them in part that they were ſubiect to death as well as others in reſpect of the body by reaſon of ſinne; but yet Chriſt being in them, he tels them, that they were not wholly ſubiect to death as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are out of Chriſt, but that the Spirit was life for righteouſneſſe ſake, that their ſoules were nor ſubiect to death as the ſoules of others are.</p>
               <p>So then in this verſe we haue theſe two things laid before vs, firſt a conceſſion, a granting to the beleeuing Romans by way of anſwer to a ſecret obiection, that they were ſubiect to death in the body becauſe of ſinne, in theſe words, <hi>The bodie is dead becauſe of ſinne.</hi> And ſecondly, a chearing them vp, and comforting of them in this reſpect, that their ſoules were free from death, yea that Chriſt being in them, their ſoules were partakers of life becauſe of righteouſneſſe, laying the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ending together: <hi>If Chriſt be in you the bodie is dead becauſe of ſinne, but the Spirit is life for righteouſneſſe ſake.</hi> And ſo we ſee the generall drift and purpoſe of the Apoſtle in this verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Chriſt be in you.</hi> This phraſe is all one in ſence with that verſe 1.<note place="margin">Interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
                  <hi>In Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and the meaning is this, if you be ioyned and knit to Chriſt, and one with him by ſpirituall vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and coniunction, by the bond of his Spirit, and by true faith, as his members. <hi>The bodie is dead.</hi> By the <hi>bodie</hi> ſome would haue the vnregenerate part of man to be meant, but indeed in that ſenſe the Apoſtle vſeth to oppoſe fleſh and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and not bodie and ſpirit. And againe the bodie is neuer put for ſinne without ſome addition, as the bodie of ſinne, the bodie of death, and the like. The word <hi>bodie</hi> (as I conceiue) is here to be taken in the proper ſence and ſignification, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for that part of man which is called the bodie, the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall part of man, and that is moſt agreeable to the purpoſe of the Apoſtle, and to the context, euen to that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſubioynes in the next verſe touching quickening and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vp of the bodie from the dead, <hi>Is dead,</hi> that is, is fraile,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:492:115"/> corruptible, and mortall, or ſubiect to death, as 1. Corinth. 15.53. <hi>For this corruptible muſt put on incorruption, and this mortall muſt put on immortalitie. Becauſe of ſinne:</hi> that is, becauſe of the remainder of ſinne, or by reaſon of ſinne ſtill abiding in you in part though you be in Chriſt; euen the remainder of ſinne that ſtill abides in you, makes you liable to death of bodie, though the venome and ſting of death be remoued from you by the death of Chriſt. <hi>But the Spirit is life.</hi> Some here againe would haue the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> to ſignifie the holy Ghoſt, but that is not anſwerable to the other member of the oppoſition (the body.) By <hi>ſpirit</hi> we are to vnderſtand, as an oppoſite me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the bodie, the ſoule of man; and yet not the ſoule ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but the ſoule renewed, the ſoule ſanctified, the ſpirituall part of man, namely, the ſoule being renewed by the Spirit of God, and therefore called Spirit. Hebr. 12.23. The holy Ghoſt cals the holy ſoules of the Saints in heauen, <hi>ſpirits of iuſt and perfect men. Is life,</hi> that is, aliue, or liuely now by grace, (as <hi>the iuſt</hi> is ſaid <hi>to liue by faith,</hi> Rom. 1.17.) and ſhal hereafter liue the life of glorie in heauen. <hi>For righteouſneſſe ſake,</hi> or <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of righteouſneſſe:</hi> that is, becauſe of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed, which giues right and title to life and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Now then thus conceiue we the meaning of the Apoſtle in the words of this verſe, as if he had ſaid.</p>

                  <hi>If you be ioyned and knit to Chriſt, and one with him by the bond of his Spirit, and by faith; your bodies indeed are fraile, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and mortall, and ſubiect to death by reaſon of ſinne ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in you in part, though the venome and ſting of ſinne be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from you by Chriſt; but yet your renewed and ſanctified ſoules, your ſoules renewed by the Spirit of God, are aliue, and they liue now the life of grace, and ſhall hereafter liue the life of glorie in heauen, becauſe of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed to you,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:492:116"/> which giues you right and title to life and ſaluation: and in regard of righteouſneſſe inherent in you, not as a meritorious cauſe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is a ſure and infallible ſigne of imputed righteouſneſſe, to which eternall life and ſaluation belongs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle here ſaith, If Chriſt be in you; and in the next verſe, If the Spirit of him that raiſed vp Ieſus Chriſt from the dead dwell in you. He ſpeaks conditionally, being to deliuer matter of comfort, he propounds it with a condition, thereby teaching vs thus much.</p>

Alas, many deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they thinke that Gods mercy and ſweete comforts in Chriſt belong to them, and that Chriſt is their Sauiour, and died for them, and that they ſhall be ſaued by him howſoeuer they liue, though they be drunkards, common ſwearers, filthy adulterers, and make no conſcience of any ſinne.

               <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If Chriſt be in you,</hi> which as I ſhewed is all one as if he had ſaid, If thou be in Chriſt, if thou be ioyned and knit to Chriſt by the bond of his Spirit, and by faith. I might here ſtand to ſhew the neareneſſe of that vnion that is betwixt Chriſt and his members, that they are ſo nearely knit together, as that Chriſt is in them and they in Chriſt; but that we ſtood on verſe 1. and therefore I paſſe by it: onely here obſerue we, that the Apoſtle hauing ſaid verſe before, that the Spirit of God which he alſo cals the Spirit of Chriſt, dwelt in the beleeuing Romans: here he ſaith, If Chriſt be in you, if you belong to Chriſt, and one with Chriſt. Now from this context we may note the manner of Chriſt his dwelling in Gods children, that it is by his Spirit. The point hence is this.</p>
               <p>That Chriſt is one with true beleeuers and with his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <label type="milestone">

Indeed it is true that Chriſt ſaith, Ioh. 6.53. that we <hi>muſt eate his fleſh and drinke his bloud, or elſe we haue no life in vs:</hi> we muſt be as nearely knit and ioyned to Chriſt, euen to his bodie and to his fleſh, and by his fleſh to his Godhead and diuine nature, as our meate and drinke which nouriſh our bodies, are ioyned to our bodies, which are turned into the verie ſubſtance of our bodies; there muſt be ſo neare a vnion betwixt Chriſt and vs: but yet our vnion with Chriſt is not a corporall vnion, but a ſpirituall vnion, as Chriſt ſaith, Ioh. 6.63. <hi>It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing.</hi> And though the bodie of Chriſt be truly receiued of vs in the Sacrament, yet it is not receiued corporally, but ſpiritually and ſacramentally: the bodie of Chriſt is truly preſent in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to the ſoule and to the ſpirit, and truly apprehended and receiued by faith. Chriſt ſaith, Ioh. 6.35. <hi>He is the bread of life, and he that comes to him ſhall neuer hunger:</hi> an then he ſubioynes, <hi>He that beleeueth in me ſhall neuer thirſt.</hi> Our vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt is ſpirituall by the bond of his Spirit, and our partaking of the bodie of Chriſt in the Sacrament is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and there needs no carnall preſence to make our vnion with him. And therefore it is a groſſe imagination and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the Papiſts, that in the Sacrament the bread muſt be turned into the very body of Chriſt, that ſo we may be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his body and of his fleſh.</p>
               <p>I proceed to further matter. <hi>And if Chriſt be in you, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is dead becauſe of ſinne.</hi> We ſee here that the Apoſtle grants
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:492:117"/> this, that Chriſt being in the beleeuing Romans, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with Chriſt, yet their bodies were fraile, and cortup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, and mortall. And ſo the point hence ariſing is this.</p>
               <p>That all men, euen the godly and deareſt of the Saints and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> ſeruants of God, in reſpect of their bodies, are fraile,<note place="margin">All men both good and bad are ſubiect to frailties, infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and diſeaſes, &amp; to death of body</note> and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and mortall, and ſubiect to death. All men both good and bad, are liable and ſubiect to frailties, and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to ſickneſſes, and diſeaſes of the body, yea to death it ſelfe: and the godly and true beleeuers muſt die as well as the wicked and vnbeleeuers. And to this purpoſe we haue plaine euidence of Scripture. Pſal. 49.19<note place="margin">Pſal. 49.19.</note> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Men ſhall enter into the generation of their fathers, and they ſhall not liue for euer:</hi> they ſhall not for euer continue in this life, but they ſhall certainly die at length.

                  <hi>What man liueth and ſhall not ſee death?</hi> &amp; <hi>ſhall he deliuer his ſoule from the hand of the graue?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Certainly there is no man liuing good or bad, but he ſhall die, and he ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer himſelfe from the power of the graue.

                  <hi>There is a time for euery one to be borne, and a time to dye.</hi> The Scripture is plentifull in this point. Deuter. 31.14. the Lord tels his deare and holy ſeruant <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he muſt dye. And to this purpoſe we might bring the examples of all the Saints and ſeruants of God in all ages, to ſhew that they as well as others haue bene ſubiect to frailties, infirmities, and to griefe of bodie, and to mortalitie, and death it ſelfe: yea we ſee it ſo to be in common and daily experience.

                  </label> and ground of this, (beſides that we haue here rendred by the Apoſtle, namely, ſinne ſtill abiding in them, in the beſt and deareſt of Gods children, that the bodie is fraile <hi>becauſe of ſinne,</hi>) beſides this, is that we find put downe Geneſ. 3.19. <hi>Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt returne.</hi> The body of euery man, whether good or bad, godly or wicked, is fraile, brittle, and corruptible: euery mans bodie is a compound of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible matter, and therefore as the Author to the Hebrewes ſaith, Hebr. 9.27. <hi>It is appointed to men that they ſhall once dye:</hi>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:492:118"/> It is a law, or as it were a ſtatute enacted in the high Court of heauen; it is the common law of nature, that euery man ſhall once dye. And it is as naturall for mans bodie to be weake, and ſicke, and diſeaſed, and to die, as it is for the graſſe, and flowers, and leaues, to fade, and to wither, and to fall. It is the compariſon of the holy Ghoſt, Iſay 40.6.7. <hi>All fleſh is graſſe, and all the grace thereof is as the flower of the field. The graſſe wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth, the flower fadeth, becauſe the Spirit of the Lord bloweth vpon it: ſurely the people is graſſe.</hi> If any here obiect the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Eliah,</hi> that they were taken away and ſaw not death, as Hebr. 11.5. <hi>By faith Henoch was taken away, and he ſaw not death.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith, 1.

The ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of <hi>Henoch</hi> was miraculous and extraordinarie, it was to ſhew that God hath power ouer the order of nature, and that he is not tyed to the order of nature, but can and doth ſometimes cauſe things to come to paſſe aboue nature, and contrarie to the order of nature: as the fire not to burne, Dan. 3.27. and the waters that are heauie and fall downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>to riſe vp on an heape,</hi> Exod. 14.21.22. Againe, that of the Apoſtle alledged 1. Corinth. 15.51. is to be vnderſtood of ſuch as ſhall be found aliue at the comming of Chriſt to iudgement, to them a change ſhall be in ſtead of death. So that this we are to hold for a certaine truth, that all men, euen the godly and deareſt of the Saints, as well as others, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their bodies, are fraile, and corruptible and mortall, and all men both good and bad, are liable and ſubiect to frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and infirmities, to ſickneſſes and diſeaſes of the body, yea to death it ſelfe.</p>

No, no, the bodies of the deareſt of Gods children are fraile and corruptible, and ſubiect to like infirmities that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:492:118"/> the bodies of other men are: and as Eccleſ. 9.1.2. <hi>No man knoweth either loue or hatred of all that is before them: all</hi> (out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) <hi>things come alike to all: and the ſame condition is to the iuſt and to the wicked, to the good and to the pure, and to the polluted: and to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacrificeth not; as is the good, ſo is the ſinner; he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an oath.</hi> And further, we are not to iudge of men by the effects of thoſe ſtrong and violent diſeaſes that are in their bodies.<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>A deare child of God in time of ſome ſtrong and violent diſeaſe, may be ſtirred vp to impatience, and through the violence of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, not onely tormenting his body, but bereauing his mind of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vſe of reaſon, may ſhew forth ſtrange behauiour: yea he may dye ſhewing forth ſtrange behauiour, and yet are not we to iudge him an hypocrite, or forſaken of God, and out of his fauour. No, a child of God may dye ſhewing forth ſtrange behauiour, and a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man may dye (as we vſe to ſay) like a lambe, and as a bird in a ſhell, and as he hath had no knot in his life, his life hath bene drawn out with an euen threed, ſo there may be no bands in his death:</hi> as Pſalme 73.4. And it is an ill ſigne when a wicked man dyes a quiet death, and therefore iudge not of any mans ſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, by the things that befall his bodie, or by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour at or about the houre of his death; but rather iudge of him by the courſe of his life: and know that though it may ſometimes come to paſſe, that a violent death may depriue a repentant ſinner, a child of God, of the right vſe of reaſon for a time, yet it cannot depriue him of Gods fauour in Chriſt, nor his ſoule of eternall life.</p>
               <p>Againe, is it ſo that all men, euen the godly and deareſt of <label type="milestone">

And though we be ſuch as haue aſſurance of Gods loue, and of the pardon of our ſinnes, yet we muſt conſider that ſickneſſes and diſeaſes come becauſe of ſinne originally, and the bodie is ſicke becauſe of ſinne: and we are thus to thinke with our ſelues, Surely this ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and this diſeaſe that is now on my bodie, it is ſent to me for a good purpoſe, there is ſome ſinne in me for which I haue not bene thorowly humbled; and therefore the Lord of his mercie would by this meanes driue me to a ſound and thorow humiliation for it: though I daily make confeſſion of my ſinnes to God, yet there is ſome ſinne in me for which I ought to be more deeply humbled, and to this end hath he ſent this ſickneſſe; for certainly if I had iudged my ſelfe, the Lord would not thus iudge me.<note place="margin">1.

Thus are we, though aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Gods loue, and the pardon of our ſinnes, yet thus are we to carrie our ſelues in time of ſickneſſe. And howſoeuer we may lawfully take phyſicke, good diet, and the like, yea we are bound ſo to do; yet we are eſpecially to ſeeke for the pardon of our ſinnes: yea we are rather to deſire the pardon of our ſinnes, then releaſe of our paine, and deliuerance out of our ſickneſſe; and we are rather to deſire that the hand of God on vs may be ſanctified to vs, then that it may be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from vs, that we may be truly humbled, and that ſinne may be more lothſome to vs: and if we be reſtored to health againe, that we may come out of that ſickneſſe purged and made more carefull to walke humbly before the Lord, and more carefull to pleaſe him in all things. And remember we that ſpeech of Chriſt to the man healed of his diſeaſe, Ioh. 5.14. <hi>Thou art made whole, ſinne no more leſt a worſe thing come vnto thee.</hi> If men and women be not bettered by their ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and diſeaſes, certainly they are made worſe by them, and then their ſickneſſe is but a <hi>praeludium,</hi> but a fore-runner of greater euils.</p>

Euery one of vs is to make account of death euery moment; euen before we go out of this place, the Lord may ſtrike vs ſuddenly dead: we carrie about with vs matter and meanes of death continually; the arrow of death, namely, ſinne, it ſticks as it were in our bodies, yea it ſticks in our very bowels: And how ought this to ſtirre vs vp to prepare for death euery moment, yea ſo to carrie our ſelues, as euery moment readie to yeeld vp the ghoſt, euen to our power to be doing of good while we haue time, that our maiſter when

Death onely ſeuers the ſoule of a child of God from his bodie, and then his ſoule liues an immortall and a happie life; and death is ſo far from depriuing a child of God of the comfort of his hope, as it ſends him to the preſent poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that happineſſe which he hath long hoped for; and his ſoule being looſed from his bodie, it is freed from ſorrow

Indeed, if it were as the Papiſts teach, that the righteouſneſſe ſeruing to iuſtification in Gods ſight, were that which is inherent in Gods children, or the good workes done by themſelues, they might iuſtly doubt of the ſufficiencie of it: but being the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed, they haue no cauſe of any ſuch doubt, they want no righteouſneſſe to their iuſtification in the ſight of God, nor any merit to their eternall ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

And this comfort the Apoſtle propounds not barely, but in the proofe of it he proues it by an argument taken from the effect of Gods Spirit dwelling in them, on this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manner, If the Spirit of God dwell in you, he will certainly quicken your mortall bodies, he will not ſuffer your dead bodies alwayes to abide vnder the power of death; it is his office to quicken, and to giue life, and he will performe his office: he will one day put life into your bodies though they be dead, and he will raiſe them vp againe to an heauenly and glorious life, that the whole man may liue and be bleſſed for euer.</p>
               <p>Now this proofe of the quickening and raiſing vp of the dead bodies of the true beleeuing Romans, from the indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Gods Spirit in them, is amplified and enlarged by the worke of Gods Spirit in raiſing vp Chriſt from the dead, <hi>à paribus,</hi> namely thus, God raiſed vp Chriſt from the dead by his Spirit, and therefore by the ſame Spirit he will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe or in like manner quicken and raiſe vp your mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, you being me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of Chriſt: he raiſed vp Chriſt the head, he will likewiſe raiſe vp the members. <hi>If the Spirit of him that raiſed vp Ieſus from the dead dwell in you, he that raiſed vp

Now the word <hi>quicken</hi> here vſed, is verie emphaticall and weightie, it ſignifies thus much, Shall not onely raiſe from death to life, nor yet to an immortall life onely, for ſo the bodies of the wicked ſhall be, they ſhall be raiſed from the dead, and they ſhall be made immortall, and able to abide for euer in the ſtate whereto they ſhall be iudged: but to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Corinth. 15.44. that is, bodies not onely quickened by a liuing ſoule, but with a farre more excellent vertue, namely, the vertue of the Spirit deſcending from Chriſt their head: ſo much is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed and ſignified by the word <hi>quicken.

The meaning then of the Apoſtle in the words of this verſe is thus to be conceiued, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if the holy Spirit of God the Father, who raiſed vp the body of Ieſus when it was crucified and dead, from death to life, be in you by his true powerfull working preſence, and by the efficacie of his grace, euen the ſame God that did raiſe vp the body of Chriſt from death to life, ſhall alſo, and in like manner, raiſe your bodies that are mortall and ſubiect to death, euen when they are dead, from death to life, yea to an immortall happie life, and to a life perfectly glorious: and ſhall make your bodies ſpirituall, and like to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body of Chriſt, by the power and vertue of that Spirit of his, being in you by his true powerfull working preſence, and by the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of his grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt obſerue we, that the Apoſtle here chearing vp the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing Romans, with this comfort, that though their bodies were mortall, and though they were dead, yet they ſhould not alwayes abide vnder the power of death, but ſhould be quickened and raiſed vp againe from death to life; he puts downe this comfort in the proofe of it, that Gods Spirit dwelling in them, he would not ſuffer their bodies to abide vnder the power of death, but would one day raiſe them vp againe from death to life. Hence we are giuen to vnderſtand thus much.</p>

And this truth is euident and cleare from the buriall of Chriſt, in that he was buried by <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> as appeares Mat. 27.59.60. the text ſaith, <hi>Ioſeph tooke the body of Ieſus, and wrapped it in a cleane linnen cloth, and put it into his new tombe which he had hewed out in a rocke, and rolled a great ſtone to the dore of the ſepulcher.</hi> And with him ioyned <hi>Nicodemus</hi> that came to Ieſus

The raiſing vp of Chriſt from the dead, was a worke of the whole hand of God, and the looſing of thy ſorrowes and of the bonds of thy diſtreſſe, is but a worke as it were of his little finger: and therefore be not diſcouraged in thy grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt diſtreſſe; thou being a child of God, he will ſet thee free from it in his due time, if it may be for his owne glorie and thy good.

               <p>Now in that the Apoſtle here ſaith, that God that raiſed vp Chriſt ſhould alſo quicken the mortall bodies of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing Romans, we are giuen to vnderſtand thus much.</p>
               <p>That the dead bodies of Gods children, &amp; true beleeuers, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>5</label> ſhall not alwayes abide vnder the power of death,<note place="margin">The dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Gods children ſhall one day be quickened &amp; raiſed vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to life againe.</note> but ſhall one day be quickened and raiſed vp from death to life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

The Scripture is plentifull in the proofe of this truth, Iob 19.25.26.27. <hi>I am ſure</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iob) that my Redeemer liueth, and he ſhall ſtand the laſt on the earth. And though after my skinne wormes deſtroy this bodie, yet ſhall I ſee God in my fleſh. Whom I my ſelfe ſhall ſee, and mine eyes ſhall behold, and none other for me, though my reines are conſumed within me.</hi> Iſay 26.19. the Lord ſaith by the Prophet, <hi>Thy dead men ſhall riſe, euen with my bodie ſhall they riſe: awake and ſing, ye that dwell in the duſt.</hi> 1. Corin. 15. the Apoſtle proues the reſurrection of the dead bodies of true beleeuers by many ſtrong and vnanſwerable arguments, I will not ſtand to repeate them particularly, onely marke what he ſaith from verſe 13. to 18. <hi>If there be no reſurrection of the dead,</hi> if the dead ſhall neuer riſe againe, <hi>then is Christ not riſen, then the faith of Chriſtians is vaine, the preaching of the Gospell vaine:</hi> and the godly departed this life are periſhed. All which are foule and groſſe abſurdities, therefore doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the bodies of Gods children and true beleeuers ſhal not alwayes abide vnder the power of death, but ſhall one day be raiſed from death to life againe.</p>
               <p>There be many grounds of this truth,<note place="margin">Grounds of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the body.</note> it is built on many ſtrong grounds, as on the truth of the word of God, wherein reward is promiſed to the good and godly, and the iuſtice of

The ſame Spirit that raiſed the bodie of Chriſt being dead, ſhall alſo raiſe the dead bodies of his members: for the ſame working cauſe will certainly bring forth the ſame effect, hauing nothing more to hinder it in the one then in the other. And therefore it muſt needs be, that the dead bodies of Gods children and true beleeuers ſhall not alwayes abide vnder the power of death, but ſhall one day be raiſed vp from death to life.</p>

Why, theſe eyes ſay they, ſhall be putrified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and can they be reſtored againe? Ah poore ignorant ſot, whoſoeuer thou art, thou ſpeakeſt ignorantly, thou knoweſt not <hi>the Scriptures nor the power of God,</hi> as Chriſt ſaid to the Sadduces, Mat. 22.29. yea thou ſpeakeſt as an Atheiſt; and herein thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe no better then a vile wicked Atheiſt, for herein thou denieſt the truth of God, the power of God, the iuſtice of God, the mercie of God: and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou denieſt God himſelfe, and thou art no better then a monſtrous Atheiſt: for on all theſe grounds ſtandeth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the bodie, yea the reſtoring of the ſelfe ſame
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:492:135"/> bodies that now we haue, with euery part and parcell of them. God who is truth it ſelfe and cannot lye, hath ſaid it ſhall be ſo: we find it on record as part of Gods eternall truth reuealed in his word.</p>
               <p>And againe, God who was able to make all things of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, is much more able to make euery mans bodie at the reſurrection of his owne matter, yea to diſtinguiſh the duſt of one mans bodie from the duſt of another. Thou ſayeſt, thou canſt not beleeue that the ſelfe ſame eyes that are in thy head ſhall be reſtored againe. I pray thee who made the eyes? did not God? and whereof did he make them? was it not of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? where were thine eyes an hundred yeares ago? And is not he that made thine eyes of nothing, able to reſtore them being diſſolued and turned to duſt? <hi>The Lord,</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Iſay 40.12. <hi>hath the waters in his fiſt, and he comprehendeth the duſt of the earth in a meaſure:</hi> and it is more eaſie for him to diſcerne the duſt of one mans bodie from another, then it is for a man that hath his hand full of ſeuerall ſeeds, to open his hand, and to ſeuer one kind of ſeed from another, and to put euery ſort of ſeed by it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And further, the iuſtice of God requires that the ſelfe ſame bodies ſhould be reſtored, and no other for them: for as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2. Corinth. 5.10. <hi>Euery one muſt receiue the things done in his bodie according to that he hath done, whether it be good or euill.</hi> And it ſtands not with the iuſtice of God that one bodie ſhould do good things, or ſuffer for well doing, and another bodie ſhould receiue the crowne. Shall the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Saints in this world endure bonds, impriſonment, racking and rending, whipping and ſcourging, and the ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching heate of the fire till they be turned to aſhes, and ſhall other bodies for them be glorified? And ſhall the wicked in their bodies worke wickedneſſe, and practiſe filthineſſe, and ſhall other bodies for them receiue the wages of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie? No, no, it cannot be, the iuſtice of God will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it. And laſtly the glorie of Gods mercie requires that the ſelfe ſame body ſhould be raiſed. For ſhall the malice of Satan and ſinne bring that on the bodie which the mercie of God
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:492:135"/> cannot remedie? it is not poſſible: and therefore on theſe grounds learne we to be ſtrengthened in that article of our Chriſtian faith, that the dead bodies of all, good and bad, ſhal one day be raiſed vp, and haue life put into them againe, yea euen the ſelfe ſame bodies that men, both the godly and wicked, are clothed withall, ſhall be reſtored, and euery part and parcell of thoſe bodies, and none other for them. And let vs not hearken to any motions of infidelitie, and of our owne vnbeleeuing hearts in this point, mouing and ſtirring vs vp to call this truth into queſtion: if we do, we call into queſtion Gods truth, power, iuſtice and mercie; and that is a dangerous thing, we ruſh on a dangerous rocke, it will cruſh vs to duſt and powder: take we heed of it, and withall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that this truth is a ground of ſpeciall comfort to Gods children; take away this, and ye take away the chiefe pillar and ground of comfort from a true beleeuing Chriſtian.<note place="margin">Iob. 19.25.</note> 
                  <hi>Iob</hi> in his greateſt extremitie made this the comfort of his ſoule, that one day he ſhould riſe againe, and in his bodie enioy the glorious preſence of his Creator and Redeemer, Iob 19.25. And therefore labour we to be reſolued and ſetled in the truth of this article, and to be perſwaded of it, that the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of all ſhall one day be raiſed, and haue life put into them againe.</p>
               <p>Yet further, is it ſo that the dead bodies of all, both good <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> and bad, ſhall one day be raiſed vp from the dead,<note place="margin">How carefull we ought to be in well v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of our bodies.</note> and haue life put into them againe, ſhall euen the ſelfe ſame bodies that now we carrie about, and euery part and parcel of them, be reſtored, and no other for them? Oh then I beſeech you conſider it, how carefull ought we to be in well vſing of our bodies, and of euery part and member of them. We ſhould hereupon take notice of it, that we are to <hi>poſſeſſe our veſſels in holineſſe and in honour,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 1. Theſſal. 4.4.<note place="margin">1.

               <p>For why, we muſt one day ſee the Lord with theſe verie

               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:492:136"/>
               <p>Then learne we to take heed that we do not pollute and defile our bodies, or any part or member of them with any knowne ſinne; and let vs on the ground of comfort now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, learne to poſſeſſe our veſſels in holineſſe, and to vſe our bodies, and euerie part and member of them, as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods glorie, and of holineſſe, and of doing good: and then doubtleſſe we ſhall be able to looke on the Lord, euen with theſe eyes that now we carrie about, with comfort, yea to ſtand before the Lord with ioy, and with much reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</p>
               <p>Now further obſerue we the word the Apoſtle here vſeth, <hi>quickened,</hi> ſhall quicken your mortal bodies.

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:492:138"/> that is now full of aches and paines, and haply now lyes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſore and grieuous diſeaſes, ſhall be free from ach and paine, and from all manner of infirmities: and not onely ſo, for that is the condition of beaſts when they are dead, but the bodie being dead ſhall one day haue life put into it againe, and be made ſtrong and powerfull, and ſhall feele vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ioy and delight, and moſt ſweete eaſe and contentment in euerie part and member of it. Thy bodie is now tumbled and toſſed vp and downe, and many wayes turmoiled, and thou haſt cauſe of griefe and ſorrow, weeping and mourning for thine owne ſinnes and for the ſinnes of others, but <hi>the time of refreſhing will come from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> cals the day of reſurrection.

Yea the wicked reprobate that now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne thee, and thinke baſely of thee, becauſe thou doſt not ruffle it out as they do, and thou art not ſo braue and glittering in thy apparell as they be, ſhall then ſee the brightneſſe and glorie of thy bodie, and be aſhamed and confounded in themſelues, their owne bodies being moſt foule and vgly to looke on; yea they ſhall then be foule themſelues, and crie out, Oh we fooles thought this man a baſe preciſe foole, and now behold his brightneſſe and glorie, and behold our owne

Yea thy bodie that is now heauie and lumpiſh, ſhall then be made a ſpirituall bodie; thou now complaining of the dulneſſe and heauineſſe of thy bodie in doing of good things, thou findeſt as Chriſt ſaid, Matth. 26.41.<note place="margin">Mat. 26.41.</note> 
                  <hi>That the ſpirit is ſometimes readie, but the fleſh is weake:</hi> the time ſhall come that thy bodie ſhall be no burden nor impediment to thy ſoule in doing of good things, but ſhall be acted and moued by thy ſoule without reſiſtance; yea thy bodie in euerie part and member of it ſhall be acted and moued by the holy Spirit of God. Thinke on that to thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and withall conſider, that if thy bodie ſhall be ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if thy baſe bodie ſhall be made like to the glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Lord Ieſus, and ſhall ſhine as the Sunne in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, oh what ſhall be the glorie of thy ſoule?

               <p>Now before I come to further matter of doctrine, I hold it not amiſſe to anſwer an idle cauill of the Papiſts,<note place="margin">A cauill of the Papiſts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> which they would faſten on the truth now deliuered; in that we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and ſay, according to the truth of the word of God, that the bodies of Gods children raiſed vp from the dead, ſhall be made ſpirituall bodies. They would draw this concluſion
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:492:139"/> from it, that therefore the bodie of Chriſt alreadie raiſed from the dead, and now glorified, is inuiſible: it being a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bodie (ſay they) it is inuiſible, and ſo it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent in the Sacrament and not be ſeene. A verie idle and fooliſh cauill; the bodie of Chriſt raiſed from the dead is a ſpirituall bodie: it is true, it is then ſtill a bodie not a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it is not changed into a ſpirituall ſubſtance. No, no, Chriſt in riſing from the dead, did not put away the corporall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his bodie, his bodie ſtill remaines a true bodie, a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die changed, not in ſubſtance but in qualitie; euen a bodie of a ſpirituall temper, lightſome, actiue, and able to moue any way without difficultie or reſiſtance. And that bodie of Chriſt raiſed from the dead is ſtill a viſible bodie: the text is plaine, Ioh. 20.20. after his riſing from the dead he ſhewed his hands and ſide: the text ſaith, <hi>They were glad when they had ſeene the Lord:</hi> and verſe 27. he ſaid to <hi>Thomas, Put thy fingers here, and ſee my hands, and put forth thine hand, and put it into my ſide, and be not faithleſſe, but faithfull.</hi> The bodie of Chriſt rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the dead was ſtill a palpable bodie that might be felt, and a viſible bodie that might be ſeene: and therefore it is but a meere ſhift and cauill of the Papiſts, in that they ſay the bodie of Chriſt raiſed from the dead, and being a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bodie is therefore inuiſible, and ſo may be really preſent in the Sacrament and not be ſeene. And indeed if we marke and conſider it, we ſhall finde that this argument of theirs makes againſt themſelues, euen againſt their owne ground, teaching the reall preſence of Chriſt his bodie in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for they ſay (marke it I beſeech you) the bodie of Chriſt raiſed from the dead is a ſpirituall bodie, therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, and ſo really preſent in the Sacrament and not ſeene: then it followes, that the bodie of Chriſt when it was not a ſpirituall bodie but a naturall bodie, as indeed it was before his reſurrection, it was then like to our bodies in all things ſinne onely excepted, that then it was not inuiſible, and that then it was not in the Sacrament really preſent and not ſeene; for if it were, then their argument is naught, and yet they ground the reall preſence of Chriſt his bodie in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:492:139"/> on the words of Chriſt in the inſtitution of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>This is my bodie:</hi> which words were deliuered before Chriſt was crucified, and ſo before his bodie was raiſed from the dead; and how theſe things can agree and hang together, let any man of anie vnderſtanding iudge; they entangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their owne words, and before they be aware they ouerthrow their owne grounds. I leaue them, and go on to further matter: there is yet ſome thing of ſpeciall vſe offered vnto vs from this verſe.</p>
               <p>Obſerue we further, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He that raiſed vp Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies:</hi> and he ſubioynes, <hi>by his Spirit dwelling in you:</hi> that is, as we ſhewed, by the power of his Spirit, being in you by his true powerfull working preſence, by the efficacie and power of his grace. Hence then we are further giuen to vnderſtand thus much.</p>
               <p>That it is onely the dwelling of Gods Spirit in men and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>7</label> women by his true powerfull working preſence,<note place="margin">True and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable hope of reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to life and glorie in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, belongs to none but ſuch as haue Gods holy Spirit in them by his true powerfull working pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</note> by the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie and power of his grace, that giues them good and ſound hope and aſſurance of the quickening and raiſing vp their bodies to an immortall, happie, and glorious life. There is no true hope of the reſurrection with comfort, and to life and glorie in heauen, to any but onely to ſuch as haue the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God dwelling in them, to ſuch as haue the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in them by his true powerfull working preſence, and by the efficacie and power of his grace mortifying ſinne and corruption in them, and quickening them to newneſſe of life. And for further clearing and confirming of this, marke what the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. Theſſ. 4.14. <hi>They that ſleepe in Ieſus will God bring with him:</hi> Onely them that ſleepe in Chriſt, and onely ſuch as are dead in Chriſt, will God bring with Chriſt at his comming to iudgement with comfort. And who are thoſe that ſleepe in Chriſt and are departed this life in Chriſt? Surely thoſe that liued in Chriſt, or rather in whom Chriſt liued, as Galat. 2.20. by his grace, and by the power of his Spirit, them onely will God bring with Chriſt at his com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming, with ioy and with comfort. And to the ſame purpoſe ſpeakes the Apoſtle, Coloſ. 3.4. <hi>When Chriſt which is our life
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:492:140"/> ſhall appeare, then ſhall ye alſo appeare with him in glorie.</hi> He ſaith not barely, when Chriſt ſhall appeare, but when Chriſt which is our life, when Chriſt who is the author and matter of our ſpirituall life, and by the power of his Spirit doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate that life to vs, ſhall appeare, then ſhall we alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare with him in glorie. Reuel. 20.6. it is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie is he that hath his part in the firſt reſurrection:</hi> he that is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp from the death of ſinne to the life of righteouſneſſe, which is the firſt reſurrection, ouer him the ſecond death hath no power: he ſhall be freed from the ſecond death, and he ſhall be partaker of the ſecond reſurrection, the reſurrection of the bodie with comfort. A moſt plaine text prouing the point in hand, that it is onely the dwelling of Gods Spirit in men, euen the being of his holy Spirit in them by his true powerful preſence, that giues a good aſſurance of the quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their bodies to an immortall life, to the life of glorie in heauen.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> For why, the reaſon of this is the conſtant order which the Lord holdeth in bringing thoſe that belong to his election to life and ſaluation. Gods conſtant order in bringing his choſen to life and glorie in heauen is this, He firſt reſtores life to their ſoules, he quickens their ſoules here in this world with the life of grace and holineſſe, and then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores life to their bodies; he quickens their bodies here, and makes them inſtruments of holineſſe, and of doing good things here, and then he quickens and raiſeth vp their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being dead, to immortalitie and glorie, euen to life and glory in heauen. And therefore doubtleſſe it is only the being of Gods holy Spirit in men and women, that giues them good hope and aſſurance of quickening of their bodies to an immortall life, to life and glorie in heauen.</p>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:492:140"/> eternall life, and I will raiſe him vp at the laſt day:</hi> but that is to be vnderſtood of the ſpirituall eating of the fleſh and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the bloud of Chriſt by faith, by vertue whereof the bodies of true beleeuers ſhall be raiſed againe at the laſt day. It is a ſpirituall eating of the fleſh of Chriſt, and a ſpirituall drinking of his bloud, euen a ſpirituall fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, which may be without the Sacrament, that is the cauſe of the reſurrection of the bodies of Gods children; and ſo it is onely the being of Gods holy Spirit in them, that giues them good hope of quickening and raiſing to an immortal life, to the life of glory in heauen. And indeed that the carnall eating of Chriſt his fleſh in the Sacrament, (beſides the impoſſibilitie of it) is not requiſite or neceſſarie to the reſurrection of the bodie, is euident and cleare by this, in that the Saints of God that died before Chriſt was incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, could not in that manner eate and drinke the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt, and yet they died in hope of the reſurrection to life and glorie in heauen. And therefore it is a groſſe error of the Papiſts, that carnall eating and drinking of Chriſt his fleſh and bloud in the Sacrament, is the cauſe and ſeed of the reſurrection of the bodie.</p>

                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:492:142"/> Romans to an holy and ſpirituall life, that therefore they ſhould liue ſuch a life. And he doth not barely propound his exhortation, and ſay, Therefore liue an holy life: but he doth preſſe and enforce it by ſtrong and weightie reaſons: as firſt, in this verſe by an argument from common equitie and honeſtie: euen common honeſtie requires that euerie one ſhould pay his debt. Now ſaith the Apoſtle, we are debters: ſo he reaſons, we are now to yeeld it as due debt; ſtyling the Romans with a kind and louing title, <hi>Brethren. Therefore brethren we are debters.</hi> And then he makes knowne to them to whom they were indebted, and what their debt was, yet not expreſly and plainly, but by remouing a falſe creditor, and an vniuſt debt: as namely, that they were not indebted to the fleſh <hi>to liue after the fleſh;</hi> they ought no ſuch thing to the fleſh, and that the fleſh could chalenge no ſuch thing at their hands: and he leaues the true creditor and the due debt to be gathered by themſelues, as they might eaſily gather it by the law of contraries, that they were indebted to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to liue after the Spirit: for that is the nature of contraries, that one may eaſily be vnderſtood by the other, though it be not expreſſed, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>We are debters, not to the fleſh to liue after the fleſh:</hi> but we are debters to the Spirit, to liue after the Spirit. And ſo we ſee the dependance of this verſe on foregoing matter, and the generall matter and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it. I will now as briefly as I can open the ſence and meaning of the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>
                  <hi>Therefore brethren.</hi> The word <hi>brethren</hi> is a title of loue and kindneſſe, and the Apoſtle vſeth it to ſweeten his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it is as if he had ſaid, My beloued, whom I loue and affect in the Lord, euen as my deare brethren in Chriſt, and as thoſe that are conioyned with me by the bond of one truth, one faith, and one hope of ſaluation; by the bond of the ſame Spirit of Chriſt. <hi>We are debters.</hi> We, that is, both I and you, and all true beleeuers, are debters. The word <hi>debters</hi> is meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall, borrowed and taken from ſuch as owe homage, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſeruice, money, or the like, to others, and are engaged and bound to others in any bond whatſoeuer: and the meaning
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:492:142"/> is, we are engaged, we are bound, there is a debt lyes on vs, and we are bound in equitie and conſcience to pay it: and if we pay it not, we faile in our bounden dutie, and we performe not the part of honeſt men, and we may iuſtly be taxed with diſhoneſt dealing. <hi>Not to the fleſh.</hi> The word <hi>fleſh</hi> is not here to be taken for the ſubſtantiall bodie, the ſubſtance of the bodie, for that we tender, and loue, and cheriſh, by meate, drinke, apparell, and the like: but by <hi>fleſh,</hi> as it is many times in this Chapter, for the corruption of nature, and for the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full luſts of corrupt nature; for ſo we are no debters to the fleſh. Rom. 13.14. <hi>Take no thought for the fleſh to fulfill the luſts of it. To liue after the fleſh:</hi> that is, to leade our liues according to the motion and guidance of corrupt nature, to liue a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. Now the contrarie muſt be vnderſtood, <hi>But to the Spirit:</hi> that is, according to the motion and guidance of the Spirit, of the Spirit of God, euen the Spirit of grace and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, to liue an holy, heauenly, and ſpirituall life. Thus then conceiue we the meaning of the Apoſtle in the words of this verſe, as if he had ſaid:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My beloued, whom I loue and affect in the Lord as my deare brethren in Chriſt, conioyned with me by the bond of one truth, both I and you, and all true beleeuers, are engaged and bound, we are indebted, there is a debt due from vs, which in equitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience we are bound to pay, and I beſeech you vnderſtand me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, we are not indebted to the corruption of our nature, and to the ſinfull luſts of our owne hearts; they cannot chalenge it at our hands, that we ſhould liue according to their motion and guidance a carnall life, but we are indebted to the Spirit of God, to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace and ſanctification: we are bound to liue according to the motion and guidance of that holy and bleſſed Spirit, euen an holy, an heauenly, and ſpirituall life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here firſt marke, the Apoſtle hauing before dealt by way of inſtruction, he now fals on exhortation, and to his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of conſolation he ſubioynes exhortation: whence note we.</p>
               <p>That in the right and good order of teaching,<note place="margin">Exhortation muſt follow doctrine in the right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</note> exhortation <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> muſt follow doctrine: to the teaching of truth and confuting
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:492:143"/> of errors, muſt be added exhortation and a ſtirring vp to good life. I might proue this by the conſtant courſe of the Apoſtle in all his Epiſtles: but to forbeare that, there is good reaſon why this order ought to be held in teaching the word: for why,</p>
               <p>It is exhortation that makes doctrine powerfull, effectuall, and liuely; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> exhortation puts life into doctrine, and ſets an edge on it. Without exhortation added to doctrine, doctrine onely edifies the mind, and informes the iudgement, it ſinkes not downe into the heart, it workes not on the will, and on the affections. The Apoſtle puts them together. 2. Tim. 4.2. Tit. 2.15. and therefore of neceſſitie doctrine and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to godly life muſt go together. And this teachers of the word are to take notice of to practiſe.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Good hearers muſt anſwer the order of teaching by doctrine and exhortation in their liues and conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note>And touching our ſelues, is it ſo that teaching and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation muſt go together? Surely then where theſe two are conioyned, it is the part of good hearers to be anſwerable to them both. Is this order of teaching obſerued? is the truth taught, and errors confuted, and thereunto added exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to godly life? then it is not enough for the hearers of the word ſo taught, to haue knowledge of the truth, and to haue errors rooted out of their minds; but they muſt be further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their teaching, in being carefull to leade a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, righteous, and ſober life. And deceiue not thy ſelfe in this caſe; if thou be able to ſpeake of the truth, and if thou ſay, thou art of ſound religion, thou hateſt Poperie, and all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, and falſe doctrines, and yet goeſt on in thy old wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked way and workes of darkneſſe, the word of God being truly taught and applied to thee, thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe, that word of God ſo taught and ſo applied ſhall one day riſe vp in iudgement againſt thee, yea thine owne knowledge ſhall be a witneſſe againſt thee. Marke what Chriſt ſaith, Luk. 12.47. <hi>He that knoweth his maiſters will and prepareth not himſelfe, neither doth according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> If thou anſwer the teaching of the word in knowledge and not in practiſe, it ſhall one day be a bill of inditement againſt thee.</p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:492:143"/>
               <p>In the next place, obſerue we the inference of this verſe on foregoing matter. The Apoſtle hauing cheared vp the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Romans with this, that they were not in the fleſh but in the Spirit, in that the Spirit of God dwelt in them, and he dwelling in them, made them partakers of the excellent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the life of grace here in this world, and of certaine hope of the life of glorie hereafter, both in their ſoules and alſo in their bodies: thereupon in this verſe he concludes, that therefore they were debters, not to the fleſh, to liue after the fleſh, but to the Spirit, to liue after the Spirit. He reaſons thus, God hath giuen them his Spirit, and made them partakers of excellent ſpirituall benefits, and therefore they were more bound to an holy and ſpirituall life. Marke this manner of reaſoning, and the point hence is this.</p>
               <p>That it is an vſuall thing with the holy Ghoſt in Scripture, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> to reaſon from a benefite to a dutie.<note place="margin">It is an vſuall reaſoning in Scripture, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a benefit to a dutie, and to vrge the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other.</note> The holy Prophets and the holy Apoſtles, the pen men of Scripture, vſually vrge and preſſe holy duties on people and on particular perſons, from benefits receiued, and from good things beſtowed on them. 2. Sam. 12.7.8.9. <hi>Nathan</hi> reaſons thus with <hi>Dauid, The Lord annointed thee king ouer Iſrael, and deliuered thee out of the hand of Saul, and gaue thee thy Lords houſe, and thy Lords wiues into thy boſome, and gaue thee the houſe of Iſrael and of Iudah, and would moreouer (if that had bene too little) haue giuen thee ſuch and ſuch things: wherefore haſt thou despiſed the commandement of the Lord, to do euill in his ſight?</hi> As if he had ſaid, The Lord did great things for thee, and beſtowed many benefits on thee, and therefore thou ſhouldeſt not haue ſo deſpiſed the commandement of the Lord; thou waſt bound to the Lord, and thou didſt owe to him in lieu of his benefits, homage, ſeruice, and all holy obedience. And this manner of reaſoning is vſed in the forefront of the Commandements: when the Lord publiſhed his Law the rule of all holy obedience, he preſſed it on his people with this verie argument, Exod. 20.2. <hi>I am the Lord thy God which haue brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage: therefore thou ſhalt haue no
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:492:144"/> other gods before me.</hi> Many other Scriptures might be brought to ſhew it to be vſuall with the holy Ghoſt in Scripture thus to deale, and to reaſon from a benefit to a dutie, and to vrge and preſſe holy duties on people, or on particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, from benefits receiued, and from good things beſtowed on them.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Gods Spirit and the reaſoning of Satan, the world, and the fleſh, are flat contrarie one to the other.</note>And this may ſerue to diſcouer a flat contrarietie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the reaſoning of Gods Spirit, and the reaſoning of Satan, the world, and the fleſh. Gods Spirit reaſons from a benefit to a dutie; but Satan, the world, and the fleſh, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reaſon from a benefit to the neglect of dutie, and to ſinne: as thus, I am great, I am noble, I am rich, I am wealthy, and therefore I may do this and that euill, I may ſwagger, and ſweare, and be prophane, I may oppreſſe and do wrong to others, and who ſhall be ſo bold as to checke and controll me? Doubtleſſe Satan taught <hi>Dauid</hi> thus to reaſon when he tempted him to number the people. What? thou art a king, and wilt thou be croſſed in thy pleaſure? as <hi>Ieſabell</hi> ſaid to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi> 1. King. 21.7. Doſt thou now gouerne Iſrael? as if ſhe had ſaid, Art not thou king ouer Iſrael, and maiſt not thou do what thou wilt without controlment? And hereby let euerie one of vs trie our ſelues. Doſt thou reaſon thus: I am great, I am rich, or the like, and therefore I may do this or that euill, and who ſhall controll me? who ſhall ſay contrarie vnto it? And thou being a woman, doſt thou reaſon thus, I am the wife of ſuch a man, my husband is ſo rich and wealthie, and though he be but a tradeſman, yet I may attire my ſelfe like the wife of an Eſquire or Knight, my husband is of abilitie able to maintaine it? Surely that is the diuels argument, and that is a plaine euidence thou haſt no true grace in thy heart. On the other ſide,<note place="margin">An argument of a good heart.</note> doſt thou reaſon thus, I am rich, I am great, and ſuch like, therefore I am exceedingly bound to the Lord, I would faine ſhew my ſelfe thankfull, and I cannot be ſufficiently thankfull to God for his goodneſſe and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towards me: and thou ſayeſt with <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 116.12. <hi>What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits?</hi> I would faine deuiſe if it were poſſible ſome retribution; and when thou art
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:492:144"/> tempted to any ſinne, thou reaſoneſt thus with thy ſelfe, The Lord hath bene good to me, and eſpecially good to my ſoule, he hath giuen his Sonne Chriſt to me, he hath giuen me par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of my ſinnes, and many euidences and teſtimonies of his ſpeciall loue to me: and as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaid, Nehem. 6.11. <hi>Should ſuch a man as I flie?</hi> ſo ſhould ſuch a man or ſuch a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as I, be couetous, or proud, or vaine, and gariſh in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell? ſhould I do this wickedneſſe, and ſinne againſt my good God, who hath done ſo great things for me? no, no, I may not, I will not do it, I am bound in lieu of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and bountie towards me, to yeeld to him all homage, dutie, feare, reuerence, and all holy obedience. If this be thy reaſoning, that is an argument of a good heart, and it is an euidence that thy heart is right within thee, and that there is true and ſound grace in thy ſoule: and thus is euerie one to trie himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle here vſeth this title of loue and kindneſſe, <hi>Brethren,</hi> as we ſhewed, to ſweeten his exhortation, that the beleeuing Romans might more willingly embrace it, and yeeld to it, and that it might haue a kindly working in them, they being perſwaded of the Apoſtles loue towards them. And indeed it is the perſwaſion of loue that giues entrance and paſſage to an exhortation, to aduice and counſell, yea to reproofe and reprehenſion. When men are perſwaded of the loue of thoſe that deale with them by way of exhortation, or aduice and counſell, they do then more willingly yeeld to them, they ſuffer their exhortation, their aduice and counſell, to ſinke into their hearts, and to preuaile with them. If then ſuch as are to aduiſe and counſell others, or to exhort and ſtirre them vp to any dutie, or to admoniſh or reproue them, eſpecially Miniſters,<note place="margin">Aduice, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from loue, moſt powerfull and preualent.</note> who are to deale in theſe kindes with their hearers, would haue their counſell, exhortation, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, or reproofe, to take place and to preuaile, they muſt giue ſome euidence and teſtimonie of their loue to thoſe with whom they deale; and they muſt make it appeare that they loue them dearely, and affect them tenderly, and eſteeme them as their brethren, and as thoſe with whom they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:492:145"/> by many ſtrong bonds. If people be perſwaded that the words of their teachers, whether they be words of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, of aduice and counſell, of comfort, or of reproofe, or the like, be not words of courſe and complement, but words proceeding out of a tender loue and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them for their good, it will make them willing to liſten to them, and to make precious account of them, and to take profit by them. I will not further ſtand on that. This word <hi>brethren</hi> is here onely a title of loue giuen to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and ſo not ſo materiall in this verſe, and therefore I paſſe from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are debters.</hi> The Apoſtle here includes himſelfe, that he himſelfe was a debter as well as the beleeuing Romans. He ſaith not, therefore ye are debters, but therefore we are debters. Hence note we.</p>

It is a fearefull aggrauation of the ſinne of teachers, when they teach that to others which they themſelues will not practiſe, being a dutie common to all Chriſtians. Rom 2.21. <hi>If thou that teacheſt another, teacheſt not thy ſelfe:</hi> they that ſo do, may preach ſaluation to others, but certainly they preach damnation to themſelues; and of their owne mouthes will the Lord one day iudge them, as Luke 19.22.</p>
               <p>I come to that which is here more properly intended by the Apoſtle. <hi>We are debters:</hi> that is, as we ſhewed, I and you, and all true beleeuers, are ingaged, we ſtand bound, and we are indebted, there is a debt that lies on vs which in equitie
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:492:145"/> and conſcience we are bound to pay; and if we pay it not, we deale not as honeſt men ought to do, we owe to the Lord an holy life.</p>

Indeed Gods children are the freeſt people in the world: being made free by the Sonne of God, they are free indeed, Ioh. 8.36. They are free from the rigour and curſe of the Law, free from the guilt and puniſhment of ſinne, the debt of ſinne being diſcharged for them in Chriſt: and they haue the Spirit of God, &amp; <hi>where the Spirit of God is, there is libertie.</hi> 2. Cor. 3.17. Yet there is ſtill a debt lying on them, euen the debt of holy obedience, they are ſtill bound to liue an holy and godly life; therein they are ſtill engaged to the Lord, and he may ſtill chalenge that at their hands as a due debt to him. And to this purpoſe marke what old <hi>Zachary</hi> ſaith. Luk. 1.74.75. ſaith he, <hi>We are deliuered out of the hands of our enemies:</hi> out of the hands of ſinne, Satan, and all the enemies of our ſaluation, that we ſhould ſerue the Lord without feare all the dayes of our life, in holineſſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe before him; that is a thing we ſtill owe to the Lord. Galat. 5.13. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Brethren, ye haue bene called vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to libertie:</hi> ye haue bene effectually wrought on by the word and Spirit of God, and ſet out of the kingdome of darkneſſe into Gods kingdome of grace, into a glorious libertie. Now then <hi>vſe not your libertie as an occaſion vnto the fleſh, but by loue ſerue one another.</hi> You are ſtill bound to ſerue one another in duties of loue, and therein to yeeld obedience to the Lord. 1. Pet. 2.16. <hi>As free</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and not as hauing the libertie for a cloake of maliciouſneſſe, but as the ſeruants of God.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Though you be free by grace in Chriſt, yet abuſe not your libertie, but ſtill carrie your ſelues as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God; you are ſtill bound ſo to do. Tit. 2.11.12. the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>the grace of God bringing ſaluation to all men hath appeared:</hi> to what purpoſe? that men ſhould liue as they
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:492:146"/> liſt, and go on in the practiſe of ſinne? no, no. <hi>Teaching vs that we ſhould denie vngodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and liue ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Gods children that are partakers of Gods grace to ſaluation, are ſtill bound to liue an holy and godly life: yea they are bound to it by many bonds, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly common to them with others, as by their creation, their preſeruation, and many bleſſings they enioy together with others, but alſo by manie ſpeciall bonds, and by the bond of their redemption, that they are bought with a price, 1.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vr Apoſtle in this Verſe goes on further to enforce and preſſe this exhortation on the beleeuing Romans, that they ought to liue an holy and ſpirituall life; and here addes two other arguments to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt is from the danger and vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table effect of a contrarie courſe of life, namely, of liuing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, that if they did ſo liue, death would be the fruite and effect of that kind of life: <hi>If ye liue after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye.</hi> And this argument depends on foregoing matter, as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon diſſwading from liuing after the fleſh, <hi>For if ye liue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ye ſhall dye.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Liue not after the fleſh, for if ye ſo do, ye ſhall dye.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument is from the benefit and profit that will follow on an holy and ſpirituall life, as namely, that ſuch a life would be verie comfortable, that the benefit and fruite that would follow on that, would be an happie life; yet the antecedent of that argument is not in theſe termes expreſſed, if ye liue an holy and ſpirituall life, but one part of that life, namely, mortification of ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne is put for the whole. <hi>If ye mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the deeds of the bodie by the Spirit</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ye ſhall liue.</hi> And he makes an oppoſition betweene liuing after the fleſh, and mortifying the deeds of the bodie by the Spirit, and compares them together as contrarie courſes of life, and as tending to contrarie ends: <hi>If ye liue after the fleſh ye ſhall dye, but</hi> (ſaith he on the other ſide) <hi>if ye mortifie the deeds of the bodie by the Spirit, ye ſhall liue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſee then the matter and ſubſtance of this verſe, the words of it are now to be opened and explaned.<note place="margin">Interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
                  <hi>If ye liue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh.</hi> The meaning of that phraſe we gaue in the verſe before, and it is this: If ye liue and leade your liues according
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:492:151"/> to the motion and guidance of your owne corrupt mindes and wils, and according to the corrupt and ſinfull luſts of your owne hearts, if the courſe of your life be carnall, if you liue a carnall life. <hi>Ye ſhall dye.</hi> In theſe words no doubt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had reſpect to that threatning, Geneſ. 2.17. <hi>In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou ſhalt dye the death.</hi> His meaning is, Ye ſhall not onely dye the death of the bodie, which is a ſeparation of the ſoule from the bodie, and is common to all, but ye ſhall dye eternally, ye ſhall be for euer ſeuered from the comfortable preſence of God, and ye ſhall feele the full wrath of God on your ſoules and bodies in hell for euer; ye ſhall dye both death temporall, and death eternall: yea your temporall death ſhall be as it is in it ſelfe a curſed death. <hi>But if ye mortifie the deeds of the bodie.</hi> By the deeds of the bodie, we are not to vnderſtand the acts &amp; deeds of the bodie either naturall or indifferent, as eating, drinking, walking ſleeping, and ſuch like: but the euill and ſinfull motions and ſtirrings that do ariſe from the inborne corruption in the mind and in the heart, and do entice and ſtirre vp to ſinne, as Iam. 1.14. <hi>Euerie man is tempted, when he is drawne away by his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence and is entiſed,</hi> and are acted and executed by the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and therefore called the deeds of the bodie and workes of the fleſh, Galat. 5.19. The word <hi>mortifie,</hi> is metaphoricall, drawne and taken from Chyrurgions, who when they are of neceſſitie to cut off a legge or an arme, vſe meanes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numme that part of the bodie, and to make it without ſenſe and feeling, that it may be cut off with as little paine to the partie as is poſſible; and ſo the Apoſtles meaning in this word is this, if you vſe all good meanes as it were to benumme and to take away the mouing, ſtirring, and life of thoſe ſinfull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ariſe in your hearts and minds, if you ſuppreſſe them and keepe them vnder. <hi>By the Spirit.</hi> That is, by the Spirit of Chriſt, and by the power of his ſanctifying grace that is in you. <hi>Ye ſhall liue.</hi> The Apoſtle here intends and meanes a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold life, namely, life temporall, and life eternall; in oppoſition to the twofold death we ſpake of before: as if he had ſaid, Ye ſhall liue a comfortable life, a life full of ſweetneſſe and
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:492:152"/> comfort here in this world, and ye ſhall neuer ſee death, as Ioh. 8.51. that is, death eternall; but you ſhall aſſuredly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after liue the life of happineſſe and glorie in heauen. Thus then conceiue we the meaning of the Apoſtle in the words of this verſe, as if he had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if ye liue and leade your liues according to the motion and guidance of your owne corrupt mindes and wils, and the corrupt and ſinfull luſts of your owne hearts; if you liue a carnall life, you ſhall certainly not onely dye the death of the bodie, and that an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed death, but you ſhall alſo dye eternally, and be for euer ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the comfortable preſence of God, and feele the full wrath of God in your ſoules and bodies in hell fire for euer. But if ſo be you do vſe all good meanes as it were to benumme and to take away the mouing and ſtirring of thoſe euill and ſinfull motions and luſts that ariſe from your inborne corruption in your minds and hearts, enticing and ſtirring you vp to ſinne, if you ſuppreſſe them, and keepe them vnder by the Spirit of Chriſt, and by the power of his ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace in your hearts, you ſhall aſſuredly liue a comfortable life here in this world, and you ſhall hereafter liue the life of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe and glorie with the Lord in heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt obſerue we how the Apoſtle here diſſwades from li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing after the fleſh: for I told you, his firſt argument is a reaſon diſſwading from ſo liuing; his argument to that purpoſe is a terrifying argument, an argument of terror and threatning, he threatens no leſſe then eternall death and damnation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as liue after the fleſh: he tels the Romans, that if they did liue after the fleſh, and held on that courſe of life to the end, they ſhould certainly dye, they ſhould be ſure to be damned: as if he had ſaid, take heed of liuing a carnall life, for if you ſo liue, you ſhall certainly dye. Whence note we thus much.</p>

Inſtance in one or two places. Epheſ. 5. the Apoſtle hauing verſe 3.4. diſſwaded from fornication, vncleanneſſe, couetouſneſſe, filthineſſe, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh talking, ieſting, and other foule ſinnes, and told the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians verſe 5. <hi>That no whoremonger, neither vncleane perſon, nor couetous perſon which is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdome of Christ and of God,</hi> he ſtayes not there, but he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynes verſe 6. a terrifying argument, and he tels them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that if any of them ſhould go on in the practiſe of any of thoſe ſinnes, they ſhould be ſure to meete with the wrath of God. Saith he, <hi>Let no man deceiue you with vaine words: for, for ſuch things comes the wrath of God vpon the children of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</hi> As if he had ſaid, If any tell you to the contrarie, he doth but deceiue you: aſſure your ſelues that men or women that liue in the practiſe of thoſe ſinnes, ſhall not eſcape the wrath and vengeance of God, it ſhall certainly ouertake them, it ſhall light on them. 2. Corinth. 5. the Apoſtle hauing verſe 10. made knowne that all men muſt appeare before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt, he addes verſe 11. <hi>Knowing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the terror of the Lord, we perſwade men.</hi> Marke, he affirmes that from the terror of the day of iudgement, and from the dreadfull doome that the wicked ſhall then receiue, he and other Apoſtles did perſwade men to auoid ſinne. Mat. 23.23.<note place="margin">Mat. 23.23.</note> we find that the Lord Ieſus denounceth woe after woe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Scribes and Phariſes, and verſe 33.<note place="margin">Verſe 33.</note> he ſends out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them a terrible thunderbolt, <hi>Oh ſerpents, the generation of vipers, how ſhould ye eſcape the damnation of hell:</hi> he threatens them with hell and damnation.

And therefore the Preachers of the word may warrantably vſe terrifying arguments to diſſwade men from a carnall courſe of life, and they may tell them, yea they ought to tell them, when they ſee them go on in an euill courſe of life, if they hold on that courſe they ſhall dye and that eternally, and that they ſhall be ſure to go to hell and be damned. When Preachers of the word deale on this manner, men are not to except againſt them. Now here comes a queſtion to be anſwered, occaſioned from this argument of the Apoſtle, in that the Apoſtle here vſeth a terrifying argument to diſſwade from a carnall courſe of life, and directs his ſpeech to the beleeuing Romans, and ſaith, <hi>If ye liue after the fleſh ye ſhall dye.</hi> The queſtion is this.</p>

                  </label> That Gods children are principally to auoide
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:492:154"/> euill, and to abſtaine from ſinne, becauſe it is euill, and ſinne, and diſpleaſing to God; as if there were no hell to puniſh it, yet they may &amp; they ought in the ſecond place to auoid euill, and to abſtaine from ſin in reſpect of Gods wrath and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, Pſal. 119.120.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.120.</note>

Dauid</hi> had a childlike feare of God, he feared God himſelf, he feared to offend God out of his loue to God, and yet in the ſecond place he ſtood in awe of his iudgements. And indeed ſuch is the canker of our corrupt nature, that the beſt of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue need to thinke on the wrath and iudgements of God due to ſinne, that euen in conſideration thereof they may be afraid to ſinne: as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, Gods <hi>puniſhment was feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto him,</hi> Iob 31.23. And howſoeuer Gods children are freed from the wrath of God by Chriſt, and do feare God for his mercie, yet that doth not exempt them from all feare of Gods iudgements, to keep them from ſinne. We being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods children, we are chiefly and in the firſt place to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid ſinne, and to abſtaine from doing euill, becauſe it is euill, and ſinne, and diſpleaſing to God; but in the ſecond place, we are to feare the wrath of God againſt ſinne; yea we are to call to mind, and ſeriouſly to thinke on the iudgements of God denounced in the word againſt particular ſinnes, yea to call to mind the execution of Gods iudgements on hard hearted and impenitent ſinners, ſeene or heard of in the world, eſpecially the iudgements of God that of late haue bene exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted on wicked perſons, and ſuch as are freſh in memorie: and the conſideration thereof may preſerue in vs a reuerent awe and feare of the great and glorious maieſtie of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Note we one thing further concerning the perſons more generally The Apoſtle here threatens death and damnation againſt ſuch perſons as liue <hi>after the fleſh:</hi>

I note this in a word, to ſhew the follie and madneſſe of thoſe idle
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:492:154"/> and phantaſtike ſpirits the Familiſts;<note place="margin">A fooliſh con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceit of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliſts met withall.</note> they haue this fond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that though they make no conſcience of any ſoule ſinne, as of ſwearing, lying, Sabbath breaking, whoredome, and filthineſſe, but giue themſelues to the practiſe of theſe ſinnes, yet they are excuſable, and they are in no danger at all: and why ſo? forſooth they ſay it is the fleſh that ſinnes, and not they, and they think to ſhift off the matter by laying the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on the fleſh. Poore ſoules, they are maruellouſly blinded and deluded by the diuell, they ſhall find one day that they themſelues ſhall ſmart for their ſinnes, and they themſelues ſhall be puniſhed for them: and if they go on in the practiſe of any foule ſinne without repentance, they themſelues ſhall dye and be damned. The Apoſtle ſaith not, If ye liue in the fleſh, the fleſh ſhall carrie the burden, the fleſh ſhall be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, or the fleſh ſhall dye, but ye your ſelues ſhall be ſure to carrie the burden, ye your ſelues ſhall dye and be damned: And therefore the conceit of the Familiſts is moſt vaine and fooliſh.</p>
               <p>Come we to the matter of the Apoſtles argument. <hi>If ye liue after the flefl ye ſhall dye.</hi> We ſee here the Apoſtle couples theſe two together, liuing after the fleſh, and death, as the antecedent and conſequent, and he affirmes it, that death, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen death of bodie, and death of ſoule, death temporall, and that an accurſed death, and death eternall, follow neceſſarily <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> on liuing after the fleſh, on a carnall life.<note place="margin">They that liue wickedly and carnally, and hold on a con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtant courſe in that kind of life, ſhall certainly dye an accurſed death of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and ſhall be ſure alſo to go to hell and to periſh for euer. Iud. Epiſt. verſe 18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The point hence offered is this. That the certaine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted fruite and effect of a carnall life, is death temporall, and that an accurſed death, and alſo death eternall: the liuing after the fleſh, the liuing after the corrupt and ſenſuall luſts of the fleſh, the leading of a carnall courſe of life, and holding on a conſtant courſe in that kind of life, ſhall certainly and vndoubtedly bring death and deſtruction both on bodie and ſoule. They that liue wickedly and carnally, and walke after <hi>their owne vngodly luſts,</hi> as <hi>Iude</hi> ſpeaks verſe 18. ſhall aſſuredly dye an accurſed death of bodie, and they ſhall be ſure alſo to go to hell, and to periſh for euer. Beſides the euidence of this text, we haue further teſtimonie of Scripture for the proofe
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:492:155"/> and confirmation of this point. To cite ſome few places to this purpoſe, Deut. 29.19.20. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any man bleſſe himſelfe in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall haue peace although I walke according to the ſtubburnneſſe of mine owne heart, in a wicked and carnall courſe of life, and walke ſtubburnly after the luſts of his owne heart, adding drunkenneſſe to thirſt,</hi> that is, one ſinne to another, and ſo go on and hold on in a conſtant courſe in ſinne, <hi>The Lord will not be mercifull to that man, but his wrath and iealouſie ſhall ſmoke againſt him, and euery curſe written in the booke of God ſhall light on him.</hi> 1. Corinth. 6.9.10. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle reckens vp a rabble of wicked and carnall perſons, and he ſhuts them all out of Gods kingdome, and being ſhut out from thence, without queſtion they muſt needs go to hell and be damned. <hi>Know ye not</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, as if he had ſaid, it is a knowne thing, and ye cannot be ignorant of it, <hi>that the vnrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdome of God.</hi> And againe, <hi>Be not deceiued, neither fornicators nor idolaters, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, nor wantons, nor buggerers, nor theeues, nor couetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners, ſhall inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</hi> The like threatning we find Galat. 5.21.<note place="margin">Galat. 5.21.</note> The Apoſtle hauing reckoned vp many particular workes of the fleſh, he ſaith, verſe 21. <hi>Whereof I tell you before, as alſo I haue told you before, that they which do ſuch things,</hi> and ſo are carnall perſons, and leade a carnall life, <hi>ſhall not inherit the kingdome of God.</hi> And Galat. 6.8.<note place="margin">Galat. 6.8.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He that ſoweth to the fleſh,</hi> he that followes the ſinfull deſires of the fleſh, and fulfils the luſts of it, <hi>ſhall of the fleſh reape corruption,</hi> ſhall be ſure in the end to reape the fruite of death and damnation. Reuel. 21.8.<note place="margin">Apoc. 21.8.</note> it is ſaid, that <hi>the fearefull, and vnbeleeuing and abhominable, and murtherers, and whoremongers, and ſorcerers, and idolaters, and all lyers, ſhall haue their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.</hi> Theſe and many other places do plainly euidence to vs this to be a truth, that the certaine fruite of a carnall life is an accurſed death of the bodie, and alſo death eternall: and that whoſoeuer they be, that liue a carnall life, walking after the ſinfull luſts of their owne hearts, and go on in a conſtant courſe in that kind of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:492:155"/> life, ſhall certainly dye an accurſed death of bodie, and ſhall be ſure alſo to go to hell and be damned. And there be alſo reaſons and grounds of this truth. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, the proper cauſe muſt needs bring forth the proper <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> effect, where it hath a kindly working and nothing to hinder it. Now ſinne is the proper cauſe of death, both of death tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and of death eternall; and the Lord hath ſo linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the pleaſure of ſinne and the puniſhment of ſinne, as that the one euer followes the other, vnleſſe there be ſome interruption and breaking off the courſe of ſinne by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>And againe, the Lord is moſt iuſt, and it ſtands with his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>2</label> to giue euerie man his due. Now death, euen death of bodie and death eternall, is a due debt to ſin not repented of, and not ſatisfied for by Chriſt, <hi>It is the wages of ſin,</hi> Rom. 6.23. And therefore doubtleſſe an accurſed death of bodie, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo death eternall, is the certaine fruite of a carnall life, and they that liue a carnall life, and follow the ſinfull luſts of their owne hearts, and hold on a conſtant courſe in that kind of life, ſhall aſſuredly dye an accurſed death of bodie, and ſhall be ſure alſo to go to hell, and to be damned.</p>
               <p>And this being a truth, it ſerues to diſcouer that thouſands <label type="milestone">

If thou come once to vſe this note in hell, and there to crie out, what hath pride profited me? what hath my couetouſneſſe, my drunkenneſſe, and ſuch like, done me good? and what haue I got by it? oh it had bene good for thee thou hadſt neuer bene borne: therefore now breake off thy carnall courſe of life before the fruite of it be brought on thee.

               <p>Come we now to the ſecond argument here vſed, the third in order, but the ſecond vſed by the Apoſtle in this verſe, to vrge and preſſe his exhortation on the beleeuing Romans, that they ought to liue an holy life, in theſe words, <hi>If ye mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the deeds of the bodie by the Spirit, ye ſhall liue.</hi> To paſſe by that which is offered from the oppoſition here made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene liuing after the fleſh, and mortifying the deeds of the bodie, the Apoſtle oppoſing theſe two as contrarie courſes of life, and tending to contrarie ends, <hi>If ye liue after the fleſh, ye

               <p>But to go on to further matter. <hi>If ye mortifie the deeds of the bodie by the Spirit, ye ſhall liue.</hi> We ſee here the Apoſtle ſaith to the Romans, of whom he was well perſwaded, verſe 9. that they were not in the fleſh but in the Spirit; that they were perſons alreadie ſanctified, and alreadie mortified, yet here he ſaith to them, <hi>If ye mortifie the deeds of the bodie by the Spirit, ye ſhall liue.</hi> Whence we are giuen to vnderſtand thus much.</p>
               <p>That ſuch perſons as are alreadie in ſome meaſure morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:492:159"/> them to vnderſtand, that they ought ſtill to go on in the act of mortification: yea verſe 8. he exhorts them to put away their vile luſts and ſinnes, or rather (as the word ſignifies) to put them aſide, cleane out of ſight, as dead bodies are when they are buried: as if he had ſaid, So proceed in mortifying and killing your vile luſts and ſinnes, as that ye neuer leaue them till ye haue blotted them, and put cleane out of your ſight, that is the courſe you muſt take with them: you muſt continually proceed from one degree of mortification to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. And to this purpoſe tend thoſe exhortations of the Apoſtle to ſuch as had alreadie begun to mortifie ſinne, and had alreadie begunne to put off the old man, ſtill to cleanſe themſelues, and ſtill to put off the old man, as 2. Corinth. 7.1. <hi>Seeing then we haue theſe promiſes, let vs cleanſe our ſelues from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit, and grow vp vnto full holineſſe in the feare of God.</hi> Euen we that haue right to the promiſes of the Goſpell, and are alreadie ſanctified and cleanſed, let vs more and more cleanſe our ſelues.

Though he do daily and hourely labour to cut off and to kill the vile luſts of his heart, yet ſo ſtrong and ſo many are they, as he ſhall neuer want worke in that kind all his life long, though he ſhould liue <hi>Methuſhelahs</hi> dayes: and therefore the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the vile luſts and corruptions of the heart muſt be a

Some idle and braineſicke perſons there be, who thinke they haue gone farre enough in the worke of mortification, in the worke of humiliation and repentance, and they need be humbled no further, they haue no further matter in them to be mortified, they imagine they haue finiſhed that worke, the worke of mortification is at an end with them. Poore ſoules, they deceiue themſelues exceedingly, it is out of their ignorance and pride that they haue this conceit, yea it is a plaine euidence againſt them, they know not what mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion meanes; if they had eyes to ſee it, they might haue cauſe to be humbled for that proud conceit of theirs, and that they haue need to mortifie the pride of their hearts. And indeed to leaue them, and to make our benefit of this, ſuch is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our nature, that men or women that haue made the beſt progreſſe, and haue gone furtheſt in mortification, are in danger, vnleſſe they looke to it, to grow proud of it.

That is thy dutie, let it be thought on and remembred.</p>
               <p>For the grounding of the next point obſerue, the Apoſtle here ſaith not as the direct oppoſion required, If ye liue after the Spirit, as he ſaid in the ſormer part, If ye liue after the fleſh, ſo here, if ye liue after the Spirit, or if ye liue an holy life. But <hi>if ye mortifie the deeds of the bodie by the Spirit, ye ſhall liue.</hi> The Apoſtle being guided by the Spirit of God, puts

Wicked worldlings &amp; profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they think the holy and mortified life of Gods children is the moſt vncomfortable life that can be: they ſeeing Gods children hold on a conſtant courſe in holineſſe &amp; in the feare of God, that they wil not drinke, ſweare, and ſwagger, breake the Sabbath, that they will not do as others do, to enioy the pleaſures, profits, and honours of the world; they commonly open their mouthes againſt them on this or the like manner; Oh ſay they, what get you by your ſtrict and preciſe courſe of life? what are you the better for it? do not you ſee you are hated and contemned in the world? you forgo many plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and profits that others enioy, and that you might enioy if you would do as they do, what then get you by your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe courſe? Thus wicked worldlings commonly open their mouthes againſt the holy life of Gods children. Now the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine deliuered puts an anſwer into the mouth of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to this cauill of the wicked: they may tell them and that truly, their holy and mortified life doth much aduantage them, they gaine much good by it; for why, the fruite of it is ſweetneſſe and comfort here in this world, euen peace of their conſciences, which is better then all the riches in the world, yea a <hi>continuall feaſt.</hi> Prou. 15.15.<note place="margin">Prou. 15.15.</note> and aſſurance of Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall loue and fauour towards them, which is better then life it ſelfe; and after this life is ended, the fruite of it ſhall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall happineſſe and glorie in heauen: and is that no gaine? Can Gods children be ſaid to get no good by their holy and mortified life? Oh the gaine of it is vnſpeakable. And the conſideration of the fruit and conſequent of it may comfort and cheare vp Gods children, and hold vp their fainting hearts in the time of their greateſt affliction. What though

               <p>Now we are to ſtand on the antecedent of the argument of the Apoſtle more particularly. <hi>If ye mortifie the deeds of the bodie by the Spirit, ye ſhall liue.</hi> We haue here two particulars offered to vs.</p>

               <p>The ſecond, how that worke is wrought, or whence it proceeds, namely, by the Spirit, or from the Spirit.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, <hi>If ye mortifie,</hi> that is, as we ſhewed, if you as it were benumme and take away the mouing, ſtirring, and life of thoſe luſts and ſinfull motions that ariſe in your hearts and minds, and are acted and executed by your bodies, and therefore called the deeds of the fleſh.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this 14. Verſe, our Apoſtle confirmes and proues that which he put downe in the latter part of the verſe foregoing, namely this, that all true beleeuers mortifying the deeds of the bodie by the Spirit, ſhall liue: that they ſhall liue both co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortably here in this world, and that they ſhall alſo liue eternally in happineſſe and glorie hereafter in heauen. The Apoſtles argument to that purpoſe is from the proper ſubiect of that life, or from the perſons that are capable of it, and fit to be partakers of it, and thoſe are the ſons of God, the children of God. And thus he reaſons, the ſonnes of God, or the children of God ſhall aſſuredly liue both comfortably here, and alſo happily and gloriouſly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Now ſuch are they that mortifie the deeds of the body, which the Apoſtle expreſſeth in termes equiualent, and of the ſame ſignification, ſuch are they that are led by the Spirit: and making his ſpeech generall, he ſaith, <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit, they are the ſonnes of God.</hi> They are the children of God, therefore they muſt needs liue, and they ſhall certainly liue both a comfortable life here in this world, and they ſhall alſo be ſure to go to heauen. And this argument the Apoſtle doth further confirme and amplifie in 15.16.17. verſes. I ſpare to lay forth the reſolution of theſe words, till we come to the handling of them.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>Now touching the words of this 14. verſe, I will ſtand a while to vnfold the ſence and meaning of them. <hi>For as many as:</hi> or whoſoeuer they be, of what place, calling, or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the propoſition is generall. <hi>Are led by the Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> is here put metaphorically for the effect and worke of the Spirit.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Now the acting, or mouing of the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:492:167"/> Spirit is either generall (for the Spirit workes in all creatures:) <hi>In him they liue moue, and haue their being,</hi> Act. 17.28. or it is more ſpeciall, namely, in men. And againe, in men the Spirit of God workes diuerſly, as by enduing ſome men with skill and cunning in trades, others with gifts fit for regiment and gouernment, others with the gift of prophecying, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and ſuch like. Now theſe workes and actions of the Spirit are not here meant, becauſe thus the Spirit may worke in the wicked and reprobate, but here the Apoſtle intends a more ſpeciall worke of the Spirit, namely, that worke of the Spirit that is proper to Gods children, for ſo he doth limit it: <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit, they are the ſonnes of God.</hi> And for the vnderſtanding of this word <hi>led,</hi> acted, or moued, we muſt know it is a metaphoricall word, borrowed and taken either from ſuch as are blind, and cannot ſee their way, but muſt haue one to leade them, and guide them, or from ſuch as want ſtrength to go by themſelues, as weake perſons, or yong children, that muſt haue the hand of another to ſupport them, and to leade, and to guide them; as a little child, when it begins to go, muſt haue the hand or finger of the nurſe or mother to hold it vp and to leade it. And ſo indeed are Gods children led by the Spirit, the Spirit by his working doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten their minds to vnderſtand and know the will of God reuealed in his word, and to diſcerne ſuch inſtructions as be from God. They are <hi>taught of God</hi> Ioh. 6.45. And he doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo incline and bend their wils and affections to will and to affect good things, and inables them with ſtrength to do good things. And yet that we miſtake not this leading of the Spirit, know further that the Spirit of God leades Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not as a cart or a dead thing, or as a bruite creature is led or drawne, but as reaſonable creatures. And againe, the Spirit of God leades them not violently, and by coaction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, and againſt their wils, as the Papiſts ſay we hold, but willingly: for the Spirit of God altereth and changeth their wils by grace, and of vnwilling maketh them willing, as Chriſt ſaith, Ioh. 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which hath ſent me draw him.</hi> And ſo he leades them,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:492:168"/> being willing <hi>conſequenter,</hi> not <hi>antecedenter,</hi> after their change and not before. And yet further, Gods children are ſo led by the Spirit of God, as that they follow his motion and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance neceſſarily, and ſo as they cannot but follow it, as a blind man followes his leader willingly, though it be not free for him to go which way himſelfe will. Thus we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of the worke of Gods Spirit in leading Gods children, they are led as it were by the hand of Gods Spirit, as reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures, and willingly, their wils of vnwilling being made willing, and they follow the motion, guidance, and conduction of the Spirit of God neceſſarily. <hi>They are the ſonnes of God.</hi> That is, the children of God, as verſe 16. and that not by nature, for ſo is Chriſt onely the Sonne of God, nor by creation, as the Angels be, Iob 1.6.<note place="margin">Iob. 1.6.</note> but by adoption and grace. Thus then take we vp the ſence and meaning of the Apoſtle in the words of this verſe, as if he had ſaid:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For all they, whoſoeuer they be, high or low, rich or poore, of what place, calling, or condition, that are by the ſpeciall worke of Gods Spirit, acted, moued, and guided, that holy Spirit of God both enlightening their minds to vnderſtand and know the will of God reuealed in his word, and to diſcerne things therein taught, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo inclining and bending their wils and affections to will and to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect good things, and inabling them with ſtrength to do good things, ſo as they now will, affect, and do good things, as reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and willingly, their wils being changed by the power of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying grace, and of vnwilling made willing, and ſo as they now follow the motion and guidance of the Spirit of God neceſſarily, he working in them effectually; they are the ſonnes and daughters of God, the children of God by grace and adoption: the Lord doth ſo eſteeme and ſo account of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerue we how the Apoſtle proues, that ſuch as mortifie the deeds of the bodie by the Spirit, or ſuch as are mortified perſons ſhall liue, he proues it by this <hi>medium,</hi> by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are the ſonnes of God, or children of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall liue both comfortably here, and they ſhall alſo be ſure to liue happily in heauen hereafter.

So ſaith the Apoſtle in expreſſe words, Galat. 4.4.5. <hi>God ſent

               <p>In the next place obſerue we, the Apoſtle here makes the leading, guiding and conducting of men by the Spirit of God, to be an infallible proofe of their adoption; he affirmes that they are the adopted ſonnes and daughters of God, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they be that are led by the Spirit of God.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Verſe the Apoſtle proues that he put downe in the verſe before, That they that are led by the Spirit of God, they are the ſonnes of God. His argument here is from the propertie of that Spirit that is working in them, that it is the Spirit of adoption, that they haue receiued the Spirit of adoption, and therefore they are the children of God. And this the Apoſtle puts downe with particular inſtance in the beleeuing Romans, that they haue receiued the Spirit of adoption, and to that he oppoſeth the ſpirit of bondage, denying that to be receiued by them: for ſaith he, <hi>Ye haue not receiued the ſpirit of bondage, but ye haue receiued the Spirit of adoption.</hi> And he further ſets out the ſpirit of bondage and the Spirit of adoption, by the effects, as namely, that the ſpirit of bondage cauſed feare in them. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by the time in the word <hi>againe, Ye haue not receiued the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:492:177"/> ſpirit of bondage to feare againe:</hi> and that the Spirit of adoption now cauſed in himſelfe, and in them, and in all true beleeuers, (for he changeth the perſon) and ſaith <hi>we,</hi> that is, cauſed in them inuocation, prayer, a calling on the name of God, yea a crying to God, expreſſing what title it made them giue to God, and how to ſtile him, namely, by the name of father, which the Apoſtle puts downe in two words ſignifying the ſame thing, <hi>Abba, Father: Ye haue receiued the Spirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we crie Abba, Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then the ſumme and ſubſtance of this verſe, is a proofe, that ſuch as are led by the Spirit of God, are the ſonnes of God, that they haue the Spirit of adoption working in them, and not the ſpirit of bondage: amplified by the effects, both of the ſpirit of bondage, namely, feare, and of the Spirit of adoption, namely, inuocation, and calling on the name of God, yea a crying to God, and calling him <hi>Abba, Father.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>Let vs now examine the words touching the ſence and meaning of them. <hi>Ye haue not receiued the ſpirit of bondage to feare againe, but ye haue receiued the Spirit of adoption.</hi> The word <hi>receiued,</hi> is here put for a feeling of the powerfull worke of the Spirit of God: for the Spirit of God is receiued when he workes effectually in the hearts of men. Ioh. 14.17. it is ſaid, <hi>The world cannot receiue the Spirit,</hi> becauſe the Spirit neuer workes powerfully in the world. Now by the <hi>ſpirit of bondage,</hi> and by the <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> we are here to vnderſtand one and the ſame Spirit, euen the holy Spirit of God, who is but one and the ſame, and yet hath ſeuerall operations and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings in men, yea in the ſelfe ſame men, and is therefore ſometimes called the ſpirit of bondage and ſometimes the Spirit of adoption. And we muſt know, that the Apoſtle here cals the Spirit of God the ſpirit of bondage and the Spirit of adoption, not with reſpect to the time before men be truly conuerted, and the time after true conuerſion, as ſome do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this text; that the Spirit of God is to men before their conuerſion a ſpirit of bondage, and after their conuerſion a Spirit of adoption, but (as I take it) the Apoſtle here calleth the Spirit of God the <hi>Spirit of bondage</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:492:177"/> in reſpect of his different working in ſuch as are truly conuerted, at ſeuerall times, as namely, at the beginning of their conuerſion, and afterwards. As firſt, he is called the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of bondage, in that when he begins to worke in ſuch as belong to Gods election to their conuerſion, he diſcouers to them their ſinnes by the Law of God, and what they haue deſerued by their ſinnes, and makes them ſee themſelues for their ſinnes bound ouer to the curſe of the Law, to the wrath of God, and to eternall death and damnation, and ſo in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable bondage; and thereupon they are terrified, and affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and brought to a wonderfull amazement, feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, in reſpect of that they haue deſerued by their ſinnes, euen to crie out with them Act. 2.37. <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> And that is the feare the Apoſtle here intends, cauſed by the ſpirit of bondage, when he ſaith, <hi>Ye haue not receiued the ſpirit of bondage, to feare:</hi> he addes <hi>againe:</hi> meaning as yet, or any more, as then you did in the beginning of your conuerſion.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, the Spirit of God is called the Spirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption in that after men are by the worke of the Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, and now beleeue in Chriſt, and are by him iuſtified, and in and through him adopted to be the ſonnes of God, he doth then worke in them by the preaching of the Goſpell a ſenſe and feeling of Gods loue to them in Chriſt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them that God is their father, and that by his ſpeciall grace and fauour they are adopted to be his children in and through Chriſt Ieſus: he doth witneſſe that to them, as the Apoſtle ſaith in the next verſe. And hence he is called the <hi>earnest of our inheritance,</hi> Epheſ 1.14. For the Spirit of God is called the Spirit of adoption, becauſe he both workes adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and alſo workes the ſenſe of it in the hearts of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers. <hi>Whereby,</hi> or by whom, that is, by which Spirit. <hi>We.</hi> You, and I, and all true beleeuers. <hi>Crie Abba, Father:</hi> that is, call on God earneſtly and feruently, with a childlike boldneſſe and confidence: we call on him as our gracious and louing father in Ieſus Chriſt.

                  <hi>For ye do not yet or now any more feele the powerfull worke of the holy Spirit of God in your ſelues, diſcouering to you your ſinnes by the Law of God, and making you ſee your ſelues for your ſinnes bound ouer to the curſe of the Law, to the wrath of God, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall damnation, thereby working in you a wonderfull amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, feare, and trembling, and an holy despaire, in respect of that you deſerue for your ſinnes, as you did in the beginning of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion: but now you feele the holy Spirit of God working in you powerfully by the preaching of the Gospell, a ſenſe and feeling of Gods loue to you in Chriſt, and perſwading you that God is your Father, you by his ſpeciall loue and fauour his adopted children in and through Chriſt Ieſus; by which holy Spirit of God thus wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in vs, both I and you, and all true beleeuers are able, and do call on God earneſtly, and feruently, and with childlike boldneſſe and confidence, as our gracious and louing father in Ieſus Chriſt, yea we call on him with vehemencie, and feeling affections, Father, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now from the Apoſtles argument, by which he proues that ſuch as are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God, becauſe they haue receiued the Spirit of adoption, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing to them Gods loue to them in Chriſt, I forbeare to ſpeake, we ſhall more fitly ſpeake of that in the next verſe.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place here obſerue we, the Apoſtle ſaith, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing Romans had not now the Spirit working in them as a ſpirit of bondage, as they had in the beginning of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, but now they felt him working in them as a Spirit of adoption; they had not receiued the ſpirit of bondage to feare againe, but they had receiued the Spirit of adoption: whence we are giuen to vnderſtand thus much.</p>

The holy Spirit of God holds this courſe in all that belong to Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection: he diſcouers to them by the Law of God their ſinnes, and what they haue deſerued by them, euen the curſe of the

Theſe are his words; whence it is cleare, that the amazement, terrors, and feares that are in a child of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome ſinne committed by him, and his thinking of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for a time no better then a reprobate and a forlorne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are not properly wrought in him by the holy Spirit of God, but they come from his owne blindneſſe, and from his owne weakeneſſe and corruption ſtill abiding in him.

And therefore though a child of God after ſome ſinne committed, may haue amazement, terrors, and feares, yet thoſe terrors and feares come not properly from the holy Spirit of God in him, but

And the terrors and feares with which the Spirit of God is pleaſed to humble Gods elect for a time, are ſauing terrors and feares, and the Spirit of God makes them tend to their comfort and ſaluation.

No, no, they are but lippe labour, and indeed loſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; yea hatefull and diſpleaſing to God.

No, no, aſſure thy ſelfe the Lord will returne thy prayet ſo vttered as doung on thine owne face: it is abhominable in his ſight.

Therefore take heed that thou do not ſo performe this holy ſeruice, labour thou to be feruent in prayer, and to put vp thy ſuites and ſupplications to the Lord with earneſt intention of heart: and to that purpoſe conſider with thy ſelfe before whom thou doſt preſent thy ſelfe in prayer, namely before the great and glorious maieſty of the Lord, before whom the Angels couer their faces, Iſai. 6.2.<note place="margin">Iſai. 6.2.</note> and labour to haue thine heart affected with the want of thoſe good things thou pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt for; and withall conſider that thy prayer offered vp coldly and careleſly is turned to ſinne, and the Lord may iuſtly repell it, and ſend it backe with a curſe in ſteed of a bleſſing: and ſo labour to haue thine heart rowſed and quickened vp to performe this duty with feruency of Spirit: and ſo doing thou ſhalt finde prayer an excellent meanes of much good to thy ſoule, and a meanes to bring downe many bleſſings and good things from the Lord on thee: and thou crying <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> the Lord will ſhew himſelfe a gracious and louing Father vnto thee in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now before we leaue this point, ſome doubts that may ariſe and may be propounded on occaſion of it, as firſt, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo that true prayer is and ought to be earneſt and feruent, and ſent out from the inward intention of the heart; hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on haply a doubt may ariſe in the heart of a child of God: whether he do pray truly and as he ought to do, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> they may vſe a ſet forme of prayer. But they will ſay, it is a ſtinting of the Spirit in thoſe that haue the gift of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing prayer. <label type="milestone">

                  </label> I anſwer againe; for them that haue the gift of prayer, to vſe ſet forme of prayer in publike being appointed by publike authority, is no ſtinting at all of the Spirit, for if it be, then the Lord himſelfe enioyned a ſtinting of the Spirit, which to thinke were blaſphemie. Reade Numb. 6.23.24.25.26. the Lord there enioyned the prieſts a ſet forme of prayer in bleſſing the people publikely. And Pſal. 92. was a ſet prayer appointed for the Sabbath, the title ſhewes it, <hi>A Pſalme or ſong for the Sabbath.</hi> Indeed ſuch as haue the gift of prayer, are not bound at all times to vſe ſet formes of prayer in publike or priuate. And let not any one take liberty to vſe a ſet forme of prayer at all times, for that cannot at all times expreſſe his particular wants. And if a man be ſuddenly preſſed by any calamitie, or by any ſinne preſſing the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and be not able to conceiue a prayer, let him then in ſuch a caſe rather go to the Lord with ſighing and groaning, euen with ſighs and groanes that he cannot expreſſe in words
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:492:192"/> as verſe 26. then betake himſelfe to a ſet forme of prayer, which it may be makes no mention of the ſpeciall grace he ſtands in need of.</p>
               <p>In the next place obſerue we, the Apoſtle here ſaith, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation, and prayer, and calling on the name of the Lord, cauſed in himſelfe and in the beleeuing Romanes by the Spirit of God, was a crying to God earneſt and feruent, and it was a crying, <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> it was with a childlike boldneſſe and confidence, it is a calling on God as a gracious and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing father in Chriſt.

And this is that the Apoſtle calls ſtriuing in prayer. Rom. 15.30. <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you for our Lord Ieſus Chriſts ſake, and for the loue of the Spirit, that ye would ſtriue with me by prayers to God for me.</hi> And this the Lord Ieſus hath taught vs, by the example of a man that comes to borrow bread of his friend at midnight, Luke. 11.8. <hi>I ſay to you, though he would not ariſe and giue him becauſe
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:492:195"/> he is his friend, yet doubtleſſe becauſe of his importunity:</hi> and then be ſubioynes verſe. 9. <hi>I ſay to you, aske and it ſhalbe giuen you, and not onely aske but ſeeke, neither there reſt, but knocke, and it ſhalbe opened vnto you.</hi> And this alſo he hath taught vs by the parable of the widow and the wicked Iudge, who feared not God, nor reuerenced man, Luk. 18.1. but the widow ſo troubled and wearied him with her cryes and importunitie, as ſhe wreſted her ſuite from him. And ſo ought we in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie manner to be importunate with the Lord, in our ſuites and ſupplications we put vp to his holy Maieſtie. Thus did good <hi>Iaacob,</hi> Geneſ. 32.26. he wreſtled with the Lord in prayer, and he gaue the Lord no reſt till he had giuen him a bleſſing. And thus we reade of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 9.18.19. <hi>O my God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>incline thine eare and heare: open thine eyes and behold our deſolations, and the citie whereupon thy Name is called: for we do not preſent our ſupplications before thee for our owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but for thy great tender mercies.

The witneſſes are two, the Spirit of God, and our ſpirit, both witneſſing one and the ſame thing, witneſſing together: <hi>The ſame Spirit beareth witneſſe with our ſpirit,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. The thing witneſſed is in the words following, <hi>That we are the children of God.</hi> That is briefly the generall matter of the verſe.</p>
               <p>Let vs now examine the words of it touching the ſence and meaning of them. <hi>The ſame Spirit,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that very Spirit we ſpake of before, the holy Spirit of God, who is to vs that truely beleeue in Chriſt, a Spirit of adoption. <hi>Beareth witneſſe with our ſpirit,</hi> or witneſſeth together with our Spirit, or, is as it were a fellow witneſſe with our Spirit. Now tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this witneſſe and teſtimonie of the Spirit, that we may rightly conceiue it, firſt know, that it is internall, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and not outward, it is not by any outward ſpeech or voyce, it is not as God gaue teſtimonie to Chriſt to be his Sonne, Mat. 3.17.<note place="margin">Mat. 3.17.</note> by an audible voyce from heauen: <hi>This is my beloued Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed:</hi> the witneſſe of the Spirit here ſpoken of, is not by any ſuch voyce, but it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, euen an inward witneſſe and teſtimonie. And againe, this witneſſe and teſtimonie of the Spirit, is not any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie and ſpeciall reuelation, appropriated and belonging to ſome excellent &amp; ſpeciall men, ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> was, &amp; the like, as the Papiſts do dreame, but it is that teſtimonie of the Spirit of God which is common to all true beleeuers in their meaſure. Now ſome would haue this witnes &amp; teſtimony of the Spirit, to be that crie that is ſtird vp in the hearts of true beleeuers
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:492:198"/> by the Spirit of God, whereby they call God their Father with a childlike boldneſſe and confidence ſpoken of in the verſe before, but indeed that crie is rather an effect and a fruite of the teſtimonie of the Spirit, then the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the Spirit it ſelfe: for the Spirit firſt inwardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades true beleeuers that they are the children of God, and then it makes them in theit hearts to crie <hi>Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> I take it therefore that the witneſſe and teſtimonie of the Spirit here ſpoken of, is an inward, ſecret, and vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inſpiration of the Spirit, the holy Spirit of God inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſecretly, and after an vnſpeakable manner informing our hearts, and inwardly perſwading vs that God is our Father, and powring into our heart a ſecret, wonderfull, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable ſweet ſenſe and feeling of Gods loue to vs, not of Gods ordinarie or common loue, but of his ſpeciall and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue; that God loues vs with ſuch loue as he beares to his onely begotten ſonne <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> in whom we are adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be his children, as the Lord Ieſus himſelfe ſpeakes in that excellent prayer of his, Ioh. 17.23.<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.23.</note> that God loues vs, we beleeuing in Chriſt, as he hath loued him.

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:492:198"/> of Gods loue to vs, euen by peace of conſcience, and other graces of the Spirit in vs, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2.

When <hi>Daniel</hi> was in the Lyons den, then was he comforted; when the three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of <hi>Daniel</hi> were in the hote fierie fornace, then did the Lord ſend comfort to them; when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were in priſon and made faſt in the ſtocks, then found they moſt comfort, Act. 16.25.

As 1. Ioh. 3.14. <hi>We know we are tranſlated from death to life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we loue the brethren.</hi> Any meaſure of true loue to God, to his children, to his word and holy ordinances, powred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart by the holy Ghoſt, is a certaine demonſtration of it, that a man or woman is tranſlated by the mightie hand of the moſt High, from death to life, and ſet into the ſtate of grace and of ſaluation: and eſpecially the grace of true iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith, is a ſure euidence of Gods ſpeciall grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to thoſe that haue it. For as true iuſtifying faith is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary fruite of Gods eternall election, and of his preordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to eternall life, Acts 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained to

Againe, by iuſtifying faith a man may know that Chriſt is in him, and how then ſhould he not know that he is in the fauour of God? Chriſt is not in the reprobate that are out of Gods fauour, but in Gods elect, in whom after they be called he <hi>dwels by faith,</hi> Epheſ. 3.17.

               <p>Now then for vſe, firſt this truth is directly contrarie to that which is held and taught by the Papiſts, it doth directly croſſe their tenent, and their doctrine they hold &amp; teach, that a man cannot in the time of this life come to be infallibly aſſured that he in particular is in the ſtate of grace &amp; of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:492:201"/> and that he in particular ſhall be ſaued. They ſay a man may haue a good hope that he ſhall be ſaued, but he cannot be infallibly aſſured of it, that they denie, and they call ſuch ſpeciall perſwaſion faithleſſe, and a damnable falſe illuſion, and a meere preſumption: and on this text they giue this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notation: Say they, the teſtimonie of the Spirit here ſpoken of, is nothing elſe but the inward good motions, comfort, and contentment which the children of God do daily feele more and more in their hearts by ſeruing him, by which they haue as it were an atteſtation of his fauour towards them, whereby the hope of their iuſtification and ſaluation is much corroborated and ſtrengthened. See the falſe dealing of theſe ſubtill ſophiſters: the Apoſtle ſaith directly, the Spirit wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God; they mince the matter, and ſay, Gods children haue as it were an atteſtation of Gods ſauour towards them. And againe, they make the witneſſe of the holy Spirit of God to be good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, comfort, and contentment in the hearts of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ariſing from their ſeruing of God, and from their owne good workes, which is a meere corruption of the text: there is no ſuch thing either in the text, neither can any ſuch thing be gathered from it by any good conſequent. And indeed the good motions, comfort, and contentment in the hearts of Gods children, are rather fruits and effects of the teſtimonie of the Spirit of God, then the witneſſe of the Spirit it ſelfe; for the holy Spirit of God doth firſt witneſſe Gods loue to his choſen, and then he ſtirres vp good motions in them, and then works comfort and contentment in their hearts. <label type="milestone">

               <p>Firſt, the perſwaſion of Gods Spirit is grounded on the truth, power, and meere mercie of God, and on the merits of Chriſt: but a Satanicall illuſion is grounded on outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings or common graces, and either in whole or part on a mans owne workes and merits.</p>
               <p>

This is but a cauill of mans carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and this is a monſtrous boldneſſe in them; for by this meanes they call into queſtion the truth and promiſe of God, the power of God, the deeds of our bleſſed Sauiour, the prayer of Chriſt, the eternall loue of God, and his vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able decree of ſauing ſome.

Let then neither the Papiſts or any enemie of Gods grace thinke that he is able to race this foundation of comfort, the aſſurance of Gods choſen, that they are in the ſtate of grace, and of ſaluation, they ſhall neuer be able to do it, it ſtands on firme grounds, euen on ſuch grounds as can neuer be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Indeed the comfortable perſwaſion of ſome of Gods choſen, that they are in the ſtate of grace and of ſaluation, may for a time be weakened through the neglect of the

Euen the drunkard, the filthy perſon, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon blaſphemer, and the like, will not ſticke to ſay, they hope to be ſaued, and to go to heauen: and ciuill honeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they are ſtrongly perſwaded that they are highly in the fauour of God, and that they are in the ſtate of grace, yea that it is God himſelfe that perſwades them ſo to thinke. Poore ſoules, they deceiue themſelues, the truth now deliuered ſhewes, that their perſwaſion is but a meere groundleſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; a man cannot comfortably perſwade himſelfe that he is in the ſtate of grace and of ſaluation, if he haue not Gods hand and ſeale to ſhew for it, euen the ſeale of his good Spirit: and he hath not that, vnleſſe he find the ſtampe and image of that ſeale on his owne heart and ſoule. The holy Spirit of God perſwades no man that he is a child of God, vnleſſe his owne heart can witneſſe that he is borne of God, and begotten againe of the immortall ſeed of the word of God, and borne anew of the Spirit of God. If thou beeſt a drunkard, a Sabbath breaker, a common ſweater, or the like, and ſayeſt the Spirit perſwades thee that thy caſe is good, and thou ſhalt be ſaued; thou art a lyer againſt the holy Ghoſt, it is not Gods Spirit, but a lying ſpirit, that ſo perſwades thee, thou beareſt not the image of the Spirit of God, but the image of the diuell: Gods Spirit witneſſeth indeed, but his witneſſe to thee is heauie and fearefull, that thou and ſuch <label type="milestone">

               <p>And for a ſecond vſe: Is it ſo that the holy Spirit of God doth perſwade them, and them alone, and none but them whoſe hearts are ſanctified and renewed by grace, and haue the power of grace in their hearts, and do expreſſe it in their liues, that they are the children of God, that God loues them, &amp; hath loued them from all eternitie, and that they are in the ſtate of grace &amp; of ſaluation? Here is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ground of comfort
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:492:205"/> for poore ſanctified ſoules, who though they be truly ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, yet in regard of the weakneſſe and imperfection of their owne inherent holineſſe and ſanctification, are many times driuen to doubt whether God loue them or no, and whether they be in the ſtate of grace and ſaluation or no. Such perſons are to conſider, they haue not onely their owne hearts to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe Gods loue to them, which becauſe of the imperfect ſanctification of them, might make them rather doubt of it then be aſſured of it, but they haue alſo the holy Spirit of God to witneſſe with their hearts and conſciences, truly ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and renewed by grace, that they are the children of God, and his witneſſe is infallible and vndeniable: the Lord can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refuſe the witneſſe of his owne good Spirit, and this is a great mercie of God vouchſafed to his children. A witneſſe we know amongſt men is called in doubtful caſes, that by his teſtimonie he may cleare the truth; ſo when the conſcience of a poore ſanctified ſinner, is wauering and doubting of Gods loue, in regard of the imperfection of holineſſe in it ſelfe, then the Lord vouchſafes his owne good Spirit to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it to him, and his witneſſe puts the matter out of all doubt and queſtion.

               <p>Come we now to ſpeake of the generall thing layd before vs in this verſe: namely, the thing witneſſed in theſe words, <hi>That we are the children of God.</hi> The ſame Spirit beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with our ſpirit, (ſaith the Apoſtle) that we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, that is, (as we ſhewed) that we are now by grace and fauour actually accounted Gods children, euen the adopted ſonnes and daughters of God, in and through Chriſt. Now here haply ſome may deſire to haue the point of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption a little further opened and cleared, they not ſo well vnderſtanding it. To giue them therefore ſatisfaction, I will labour to lay it forth a little further; and to this purpoſe know, that a child of God, is either by nature or by grace; the child of God by nature is Chriſt, as he is the eternall Sonne of God, begotten of his Father from euerlaſting, and therefore called <hi>the onely begotten Sonne of God,</hi> Ioh. 3.16. <hi>God ſo loued the world, that he gaue his onely begotten Sonne.</hi>

Surely then we muſt learne to eſteeme of them; we are to eſteeme of them as of Gods redeemed ones, and as of his deare ones, and as of thoſe that are of great price with the Lord, and of high account with his holy Maieſtie. And to this purpoſe conſider we, that Gods choſen, now beleeuing in Chriſt, and iuſtified by him, are of ſuch price with the Lord, and ſo eſteemed of him, as that for their ſakes he doth manie times extend his bountie to the wicked, and the wicked fare the better for their ſakes, and for their ſakes the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes many temporarie benefits on the wicked: yea the Lords loue to his choſen now beleeuing in Chriſt, is ſo great, as that he makes more account of one of them, then of ten thouſand worldlings, yea ten of them ſhall ſtand before him to turne him from anger to mercie, when he will not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to reſpect ten thouſand ſuch as the world honoureth for men or women of great account. If ten of them had bene found in Sodome, the whole Citie had bene ſpared for their ſakes, and had eſcaped the fearefull plague of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, Geneſ. 18.32.<note place="margin">Geneſ. 18.32.</note> And for <hi>Noahs</hi> ſake was <hi>Cham</hi> preſerued from the deluge: and <hi>Paul</hi> had the liues of all giuen him that

Are theſe then ſuch as we cannot abide, and ſuch as we hate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne? and are theſe eye ſores vnto vs, and ſuch as harme the place where they are, and they muſt be remoued or elſe we ſhall not be well?

In louing them we ſhall teſtifie our loue to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: for it is a ſure rule, loue me and loue my child, and if thou loue not my child, thou loueſt not me: and ſo indeed if thou loue not the children of God, thou loueſt not God. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one that <hi>loueth God which begat, loueth him alſo which is begotten of him,</hi> 1. Ioh. 5.1. If thou loue not the children of God, aſſuredly thou loueſt not God himſelfe, ſay or pretend what thou wilt. As the world and men of the world are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to ſay, they loue God with all their hearts, they would be ſorrie elſe, and yet ſuch as are the adopted ſonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God they cannot abide, thoſe they hate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne. Do they loue God? No, no, they lye, and deale not truly with their owne ſoules: thou loueſt not God whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou art, if thou loue not thoſe that are beloued of God. Now in the next place, in that the Apoſtle here ſaith, the thing witneſſed by the holy Spirit of God and by the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied heart, was this, that himſelfe and the beleeuing Romans were the children of God, were by grace in Chriſt actually accounted Gods children, euen the adopted ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God in and through Chriſt; we are further to take notice of the excellencie, and of the honour, and dignitie of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>5</label> Gods choſen, beleeuing in Chriſt, and being by him iuſtified,<note place="margin">Gods choſen now belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in Chriſt are aduanced to great excel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lencie and dignitie.</note> and hauing fellowſhip with Chriſt. And the point is this.</p>
               <p>That Gods choſen, beleeuing in Chriſt, and being by him iuſtified, and hauing fellowſhip with Chriſt, they are aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to great excellencie, they are highly honoured and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, they are accounted the ſonnes and daughters of the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:492:209"/> moſt High, euen of the Lord of heauen and earth, and that is a great honour to them. We reade 1. Sam. 18.18. when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> heard of matching with <hi>Sauls</hi> daughter, <hi>Alas</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what am I, and what is my life, or the familie of my father in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, that I ſhould be ſonne in law to the king?</hi> And againe, when <hi>Sauls</hi> ſeruants dealt with him to the ſame purpoſe, ſaith he, verſe 23. <hi>Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a kings ſonne in law?</hi> And ſo it may be truly ſaid in this caſe, is it a light or ſmall thing to be the adopted ſonne or daughter of God, the great Lord and King of heauen and earth? Without queſtion it is a matter of wonderfull excellencie, and to haue ſuch a ſonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is more a thouſand times then to be the ſonne of the moſt mightie Prince in the world. Iſai. 43.4. the Lord ſaith of his people, <hi>Becauſe thou wast precious in my ſight, and thou wast honourable and I loued thee:</hi> as if he had ſaid, ſince I haue taken thee for mine owne, and thou haſt bene my peculiar people, thou haſt bene excellent and honourable aboue all the people in the world. And hence it is that Gods choſen now beleeuing in Chriſt, and by him iuſtified, are ſaid to be kings and Prieſts to God, that Chriſt hath made them <hi>kings and Prieſts to God his Father,</hi> Reuel. 1.6. And 1. Pet. 4.14. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Spirit of glorie and of God reſteth on them:</hi> and therefore doubtleſſe they are honourable and glorious. Eccleſ. 10.7. the Preacher cals them <hi>Princes:</hi> ſpeaking of the confuſion and diſorder that he ſaw in the world, he ſaith, <hi>I haue ſeene ſeruants on horſes, and Princes walking as ſeruants on the ground.</hi> He meanes by Princes, the choſen of God and his faithfull ones. And indeed if we conſider the bottome of the baſe eſtate from which Gods choſen now beleeuing in Chriſt are brought, and the top of glorie to which they are aduanced, it will plainly appeare to vs that they are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly aduanced to great excellencie, and to high honour and dignitie they are by nature children of wrath, bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaues of ſinne and Satan, enemies to God, and rebels againſt his holy Maieſtie, liable to all plagues and iudgements, and in a miſerable ſtate and condition: and by the grace of adoption they are aduanced to be ſonnes and daughters of the moſt
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:492:209"/> high Lord and King of heauen and earth, yea to be <hi>heires,</hi> as verſe the next, <hi>Euen fellow heires with Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.17.</note> and to haue right and title to all good things in this world, and to the crowne of glorie in heauen. And ſo it muſt needs be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that they now beleeuing in Chriſt, they are aduanced to great excellencie, and they are highly honoured and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.</p>
               <p>And for the vſe of this, firſt this truth ſerues much for the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>1</label> comfort and for the cheating vp of the hearts of poore deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ones in the world, truly beleeuing in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Comfort to poore deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ones in the world, they truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing in Chriſt.</note> and being by him iuſtified.

The beleeuing ſhepheard, or the beleeuing kitchin boy may call God his Father as well as the beleeuing king; ſuch honour haue all the Saints of God, which may comfort them and cheare vp their hearts. Indeed the honour and glorie of Gods choſen beleeuing in Chriſt, doth not appeare to the eye of the world, it lyes hid from the world, either vnder affliction, or vnder that excellent grace of humilitie, which the world accounts baſeneſſe, and as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> (1.

Though the text originall &amp; the new tranſlation do not expreſſe the perſons, yet doubtleſſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle meanes it of himſelfe and of the beleeuing Romans: the perſons may well be ſupplied, as we find in the Geneua tranſlation, <hi>If we be children, we are alſo heires.</hi> And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here concludes his argument, by which he prooues that which he put downe verſe 13. That true beleeuers mortifying the deeds of the fleſh by the Spirit, ſhall liue, his argument being this; They are the ſonnes of God, and therefore they ſhall liue: which argument he amplifies verſe 15.16. that they haue the Spirit of God working in them as a Spirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and witneſſing to them that they were the children of God. Here he ſhuts vp that argument, ſhewing the neceſſitie of it, that the children of God muſt needs liue, becauſe they are heires; and their inheritance is life eternall, and therefore it cannot be but that they ſhall liue: that is the reſpect that this verſe hath to the foregoing matter. In this verſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by it ſelfe, there be two things layd before vs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, an excellent dignitie put on Gods children, that they are heires: the Apoſtle affirmes this of them, as a thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging to them, that they are heires: <hi>If we be children, we are alſo heires,</hi> and he doth not barely affirme this of Gods children, but he further ſets out that dignitie by the perſon with whom they are heires, and that is with Chriſt, <hi>and heires annexed with Chriſt:</hi> wherein the Apoſtle preuents an obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for ſome might ſay, Are Gods children Gods heires? Chriſt is Gods heire. This he preuents and ſaith, they are ioynt heires or coheires with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Then the ſecond thing layd before vs in this verſe, is the condition of ſuch as are heires of God, and heires annexed with Chriſt, namely this, that they muſt ſuffer with Chriſt. We are heires of God, and heires annexed with Chriſt, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally that we ſuffer with Chriſt: <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. And that is further amplified by the end of ſuffering, in the laſt words of the verſe, and that is, <hi>that we may be glorified with Chriſt.</hi> If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may alſo be glorified with him. And therein the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:492:211"/> Apoſtle includes the argument and matter of comfort to ſtrengthen the beleeuing Romans, and all other true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, againſt the bitterneſſe of the croſſe, and to perſwade them to a patient and conſtant bearing of the croſſe, and ſo he falleth on the ſecond generall part of this Chapter, which continues to verſe 31. I will lay forth his argument when I come to the handling of theſe words: <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may alſo be glorified with him.</hi> Now then the ſumme and ſubſtance of this verſe is thus much, it containes in it an excellent dignitie belonging to Gods children, that they are heires, euen heires of God, and heires annexed with Chriſt, yet with this condition, that they muſt ſuffer with Chriſt, that ſo they may be glorified with him. I will now la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to vnfold the ſence and meaning of the firſt part of this verſe, and not meddle with the ſecond part of it till we come to the handling of it: becauſe it is the beginning of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the Chapter. <hi>If we be the children of God,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> if you and I be by grace and fauour actually accounted Gods children, if we be the adopted ſonnes and daughters of God in and through Chriſt, we are alſo heires; the meaning is, we haue then right and title to an inheritance, for by the law of nature inheritance belongs to children: and howſoeuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men all children be not heires, but ſonnes onely if there be ſonnes, and not all the ſonnes, but the eldeſt ſonne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, yet the caſe is otherwiſe with Gods children, be they ſonnes or be they daughters, they are all and euery one heires without exception, becauſe with God <hi>there is neither male nor female, but all are one in Chriſt,</hi> Galat. 3.28. and all that are the <hi>children of God by faith in Chriſt are Abrahams ſeed, and heires by promiſe,</hi> as the Apoſtle there ſubioynes verſe 29. of Galat. 3. <hi>euen heires of God.</hi> Some would haue the word <hi>heires</hi> to be here taken paſſiuely, as if the Apoſtles meaning were, euen Gods inheritance, or Gods poſſeſſion, but that peruerts the intent of this text: for the purpoſe of this text is not to ſet forth what right and title God hath to his children, but what right and title they haue to the good things of God, and therfore the word is to be taken actiuely, and the meaning is,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:492:212"/> euen ſuch as haue right and title to the good things of God, euen to all good things, as 1. Cor. 3.21. <hi>All things are yours,</hi> and to the ioyes and glorie of heauen, and to that <hi>inheritance that is immortall, and vndefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerued in heauen,</hi> 1. Pet. 1.4. And <hi>heires annexed, or ioynt heires, coheires, or fellow heires with Chriſt:</hi> that is, ſuch as haue right and title to all the good things of God, and to the heauenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance together with Chriſt, he being the naturall heire of his Fathers kingdome, being his Sonne by nature, and his onely begotten Sonne; and we being heires of the ſame kingdome by adoption and grace in and through him, we are admitted to be heires with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now then thus conceiue we the meaning of the firſt part of this verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If we be by grace actually accounted Gods children, euen the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted ſonnes and daughters of God, we haue then alſo all and euery one of vs right and title to an inheritance, yea we are ſuch as haue right and title to all the good things of God, and to the ioyes and glorie of heauen, to an inheritance that is immortall, and vndefiled, and fadeth not, reſerued in heauen for vs: yea we haue right and title to that heauenly inheritance together with Christ, he being heire of his Fathers kingdome as the naturall and onely begotten Sonne of his Father, and we as heires to the ſame kingdome by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption and grace in and through him, and ſo admitted to be ioynt heires or fellow heires with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come we now to ſuch things as are here offered for our further inſtruction, and firſt in that the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>If we be children we are heires,</hi> we ſee this concluſion plainly layd before vs.</p>

And to adde ſome further euidence to this, we find in many places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that Gods children are ſaid to be heires, as Heb. 1.14. they are called <hi>heires of ſaluation.</hi> Tit. 3.7. the Apoſtle ſaith,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:492:212"/> 
                  <hi>Being iuſtified by grace they are made heires according to the hope of eternall life.</hi> Iames 2.5. they are called <hi>heires of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> And Galat. 4.7. the Apoſtle puts downe the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>If thou be a ſonne, thou art alſo an heire of God through Chriſt.</hi> Coloſ. 1.12. the Apoſtle giues thankes to God that he had made the beleeuing Coloſſians <hi>meete to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi> Yea the Lord Ieſus ſhall ſay to Gods children at the day of iudgement, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherite ye the kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world,</hi> Math. 25.34. take poſſeſſion of the kingdome of heauen as your inheritance. The Scripture is plentifull in this, that Gods children are heires, and haue right and title to all good things, and to heauen it ſelfe, and to happineſſe and glorie in heauen as heires.</p>
               <p>For why, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> the Lord hath appointed his children to life and glorie in heauen freely. As he loues them freely without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to any thing in themſelues, ſo he will ſaue them freely, <hi>to the praiſe and glory of his grace,</hi> Epheſ. 1.6. And therefore doubtleſſe they haue right and title to all good things, and to heauen it ſelfe, and to happineſſe and glorie in heauen, as heires, and as to a free inheritance.</p>
               <p>Now then for the vſe: firſt this truth diſcouers that Gods <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>1</label> children cannot challenge any good thing of this life,<note place="margin">The Popiſh doctrine tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching good works meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting eternall life, confuted.</note> much leſſe heauen, and happineſſe, and glorie in heauen, on any me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit or deſert of their owne. It is the doctrine of the Papiſts, that eternall life is giuen for the merit of good workes: No, no, Gods children haue right and title to good things, and to happineſſe and glorie in heauen, as heires, and as to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. Now (as we know) an inheritance is freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the father to the child, and not deſerued by any merit or weldoing: yea ſometimes amongſt men an inheritance is giuen to the child who is ſo farre from doing any thing to deſerue it, as that it is yet an infant, and lies crying in the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and can do nothing to that purpoſe. An inheritance is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the father out of his meere loue, and ſo Gods children hauing right and title to the good things of this life, and to happineſſe and glorie in heauen, as heires, and as to an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:492:213"/> they cannot challenge them on any merit or deſert of their owne. Indeed Gods children may comfortably enioy good things, euen the good things of this life, they haue right and title to them as heires, but they cannot challenge the leaſt bit of bread on any merit and deſert of their owne, much leſſe heauen and happineſſe, and glory in heauen: euen the leaſt good thing of this life, is giuen to Gods children out of the meere loue of their heauenly Father, as part of their inheritance. <label type="milestone">

                  </label> Yea but ſay the Papiſts, eternall life is called in Scripture a reward, &amp; therfore it is giuen on ſomething done that is rewarded.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                  </label> it is cleare that heauen is a reward giuen for the merit of good workes, Heb. 6.10. the author there ſaith, God ſhould be vniuſt, if he rendred not heauen for good workes: <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is not vnrighteous, that he ſhould forget your worke and labour of loue, which ye ſhewed towards his name, in that ye haue miniſtred to the Saints, and yet miniſter.</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> I anſwer them, they can neuer thence conclude by any good forme of reaſoning, that God ſhould be vniuſt if he rendred not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for the merit of good workes. Indeed God ſhould be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt if he kept not his promiſe, euen that promiſe that he hath made, to reward the good workes of his children. The Lord hath freely promiſed in Chriſt to reward the good workes of his children, and bound himſelfe by his promiſe to reward them, and if he ſhould forget ſo to do, which is impoſſible, then he ſhould be vniuſt; that is the purpoſe of the holy Ghoſt in that place, and that is the iniuſtice there intended by the Author of that Epiſtle. And therefore ſtill it remaines a truth, that Gods children hauing right and title to the good things of this life, and to happineſſe and glorie in heauen as heires, they cannot challenge any good thing of this life, much leſſe heauen and happineſſe, and glorie in heauen, on any merit of their owne.</p>

<pb n="417" facs="tcp:492:213"/> happineſſe and glorie in heauen, as heires, and as to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance? Then we muſt looke that we lay no claime to the leaſt good thing of this life, much leſſe to heauen, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and glorie in heauen, for any merit or deſert of our owne. It is a corruption deeply rooted in vs by nature, to thinke that we are worthy of good things, yea that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the beſt good things, euen in heauen it ſelfe, for ſome thing in our ſelues: it is the common ſaying of blind igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people, and thus they ſpeake: I know I muſt loue God aboue all, and my neighbour as my ſelfe, and if I do my good will ſo to do, God will be mercifull vnto me, and I ſhall go to heauen. Oh we muſt labour to roote out this conceit, and learne to renounce all merit in our ſelues of the leaſt good thing, and learne to lay claime to the leaſt good thing of this life onely as we are the children of God, and ſo heires, and haue right and title to it as part of our inheritance, freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to vs, out of the meere loue of our heauenly Father; and ſo learne to be thankfull to God for euery bit of bread we haue to put into our mouthes, acknowledging it to be the free gift of God, freely beſtowed on vs out of his meere loue and mercie. And much more are we to be thankfull to him for making vs heires of heauen, and freely giuing to vs right and title to hapineſſe and glorie in heauen, for that is ſuch a gift as we cannot prize ſufficiently; and in beſtowing that gift on vs, we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not comprehend the greatneſſe of Gods loue vnto vs: and therefore we are to labour to be thankfull to God for that aboue all things, and to endeauour to expreſſe our thankfulneſſe to him in all holy obedience.

Surely then they muſt learne to liue here in the world as heires, euen as heires that are yet in their nonage and in their minoritie, as the Apoſtle ſaith, Galat. 4.1. <hi>The heire as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:492:214"/> ſeruant, though he be Lord of all:</hi> So though the children of God be heires of heauen, and of happineſſe and glorie in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, yet they are here in this world as yong heires in their minoritie, and they muſt here liue as heires that are in their minoritie, they muſt be content to liue at the allowance of their heauenly Father, and be content with that he giues them here, expecting their full inheritance hereafter. If their heauenly Father here keepe them ſhort, and put them to ſome hardſhip, if here he giue them but a ſmall pittance and porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the good things of this life, they muſt be content with it, remembring this, that they are heires to a kingdome which in due time ſhall be giuen to them: they muſt here liue as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, who though he was heire of the land of promiſe, yet was content to <hi>abide intents as a ſtranger, and in no Citie, looking for a Citie whoſe builder and maker is God,</hi> Heb. 11.9.10. And if their heauenly Father do here allow them but a ſmall part and portion of heauenly ioy, and of heauenly comfort, they muſt take heed they murmure not againſt their Father, and complaine of it, that their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren haue more ſpirituall ioy, and more heauenly comfort then they. No, they muſt be content with that meaſure of ſpirituall ioy their heauenly Father is pleaſed to impart to them, and looke for fulneſſe of ſpirituall ioy, and fulneſſe of heauenly comfort hereafter in heauen; their heauenly Father is wiſe, he knowes beſt what meaſure of ſpirituall ioy and heauenly comfort is fit for them.

For what though it be ſo, that thou who art a child of God doſt loſe all that euer thou haſt in the world, thou art ſtript of all thy wealth, and of all outward good things, yet comfort thy ſelfe, thine inheritance remaines firme and ſure to thee, and thou canſt not be depriued of that. And though the diuell and his inſtruments ſeeke by vexations and troubles to make thee miſerable, yet they cannot do it: thou art happie, and ſhalt be happie in deſpite of them all. And though the Lord ſuffer them to ſtrippe thee of land and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and to thruſt thee out of houſe and home, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue thee of libertie, to ſhut thee vp in priſon, and ſuch like, yet they cannot touch thy inheritance, that is out of their reach, and they cannot poſſibly thruſt thee from that, nor diſappoint thee of it. No, no, thine euerlaſting inheritance is laid vp in a ſure hand, euen in the hand of God, whom they neither can nor dare aſſault. And though the Lord ſuffer the inſtruments of Satan to take away thy life, yet ſtill thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance remaines ſure to thee, and thou art but thereby put into preſent poſſeſſion of it. It is neither the fraud nor the force of the world, or of the diuell without, no, nor yet thine owne fleſh within, that can depriue thee of thine euerlaſting

Thou art not truſted with it; if thou wert, thou wouldſt ſoone loſe it as <hi>Adam</hi> did in Paradiſe, but God keepes it for thee in his owne hand, and ſo nothing can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint thee of it. And therefore cheare vp thy ſelfe, in time of thy outward troubles, and thy outward croſſes and loſſes: and though thou be ſtript as naked as <hi>Iob</hi> was, all thy goods are taken from thee, yet take heed thou crie not out as men commonly do in that caſe, I am vndone: thou art not vndone, thou art Gods heire, and thou canſt not be vndone; thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father ſtill keepes thine inheritance firme and ſure to thee, and all the diuels in hell cannot defeate thee of it, nor keepe thee from it. The diuell knowes it well, that he cannot poſſibly diſappoint thee of thine euerlaſting inheritance, and that makes him trouble thee what he can other wayes: and it is commonly ſeene that the diuell troubles Gods children more then others in reſpect of outward things, and he manie times (God ſuffering him ſo to do) by his inſtruments ſtrips them of wealth, and of libertie, and of all outward good things, yea he ſeekes what he can to trouble them in their minds and conſciences:<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>And it fals out that many times Gods children are more troubled in their minds in time of ſickneſſe, then others that are not the children of God. And why ſo?

               <p>One thing note we further, in that Gods children are Gods <label type="milestone">

                  </label> of this, the conſideration of this ought to ſtirre vp Gods children to eſteeme of their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,<note place="margin">How Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to be affected in reſpect of their euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> and to affect it according to the worth, and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and greatneſſe of it; they are euen to trample vnder foote the riches, pompe, and glorie of the world, and to account them droſſe and dung in compariſon of their rich and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inheritance: yea their minds, hearts, and affections are euer to be running on their faire and goodly heritage, and they are to long after it, and to wiſh within themſelues, oh when ſhall I come to be fully poſſeſt of the ioyes and glorie of heauen, and fully to enioy God himſelfe the fountaine of life, and ioy, and happineſſe, and of all good things.

And that Gods children ſhall thus partake with Chriſt in his dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inheritance, the Scripture is plaine. Coloſ. 3.4. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells the beleeuing Coloſſians, that <hi>when Chriſt their life ſhall appeare, then ſhould they appeare with him in glorie:</hi> then ſhall they alſo be ſeene with him ſhining in vnſpeakable glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.

               <p>Come we now to the ſecond generall thing layd before vs in this verſe, the condition of ſuch as are heires of God, and ioynt heires, or fellow heires with Chriſt: namely this, that they muſt ſuffer with Chriſt, amplified by the end of their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, that they may be glorified with Chriſt. <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may alſo be glorified with him.</hi> In theſe words the Apoſtle falls on the ſecond generall part of this Chapter, which he continues to verſe 31.<note place="margin">The ſecond generall part of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> And hauing in the former part of the Chapter hitherto, deliuered matter of ſweet and excellent comfort to the beleeuing Romans, and to all other true beleeuers, againſt the relickes and remainders of ſinne and corruption ſtill abiding in them, he now comes to cheare them vp, and to arme and ſtrengthen them againſt the bitterneſſe of the croſſe, and to encourage them patiently
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:492:222"/> and conſtantly to beare the afflictions they ſhould meete withall, and that by diuerſe arguments: we will lay forth his arguments as we come to them. In theſe words he layeth downe the firſt ground of comfort, which he continues and amplifies to the 26. verſe. But to keepe within the compaſſe of this verſe, theſe words: <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with Chriſt, that we may alſo be glorified with Chriſt,</hi> as they haue reſpect to the foregoing matter, are a preuention of a ſecret obiection. For ſome might ſay to the Apoſtle, you tell vs of great honour and dignitie the Lord is pleaſed to beſtow on vs; we being his children, that we are his heires, and ioynt heires, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low heires with Chriſt, wherein is matter of great comfort: but alas how can this be, ſeeing our preſent ſtate is ſo hard, and our life ſo full of troubles? Some afflicted perſon might ſay: I an heire of God, and thus poore, and thus afflicted, and vnder ſuch grieuous afflictions as I am? Now this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle preuents, by making knowne the condition that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to ſuch as are the children of God, and ſo heires of God, and ioynt heires with Chriſt; that indeed we being the children of God, are heires of God, and ioynt heires with Chriſt: yet this is our condition, that we muſt firſt ſuffer with Chriſt before we can come to be glorified with him, and to partake with him in his euerlaſting inheritance. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle brings in theſe words: <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may alſo be glorified with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in theſe words conſidered by themſelues (as we ſaid) the Apoſtle layeth downe the ground of comfort againſt the croſſe, and matter of encouragement to a patient and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant bearing of affliction. And here we haue two arguments to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is from the nature of the affliction that Gods children vndergo, that they are ſufferings with Chriſt, and ſuch as they ſuffer in common with Chriſt, and haue him as it were a companion with them in their ſuffering: <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond argument is from the end of thoſe afflictions &amp; ſufferings, that the end of them is to partake with Chriſt in
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:492:222"/> glorie, and to reigne with him in endleſſe glorie; <hi>that we may alſo be glorified with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will now as briefly as I can lay forth the ſence and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe words, and then proceed to matter of obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and doctrine. <hi>If ſo be that ye ſuffer with him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> The Papiſts render the words, yet if we ſuffer with him: and they would haue the Apoſtle here to intend the cauſe of heauenly glorie, that our ſufferings in this life ſhould be the cauſe of our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hereafter in heauen, but the very next verſe ouerturneth this conceit, where the Apoſtle affirmes, that the afflictions of this life preſent, are not worthy of the glorie which ſhall be ſhewed vnto vs. And indeed the words are not to be taken cauſually but conditionally, that our ſuffering with Chriſt (we being true beleeuers) is but a condition neceſſarie to be vndergone by vs, and a way wherein we muſt walke to life and glorie in heauen. <hi>We ſuffer with him:</hi> that is, with Chriſt. This phraſe &amp; forme of ſpeech of ſuffering with Chriſt, is not here to be taken for ſympathizing with Chriſt, or condoling with Chriſt, for being touched with ſorrow and griefe for the ſufferings of Chriſt, as the phraſe is vſed, 1. Cor. 12.26. <hi>If one member ſuffer, all ſuffer with it:</hi> but for ſuffering as Chriſt hath ſuffered, both in reſpect of the cauſe and manner of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and for <hi>hauing fellowſhip and communion with Chriſt in his afflictions,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, Philip. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.10. And the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, <hi>If we ſuffer as Chriſt hath ſuffered,</hi> both in reſpect of the cauſe and manner of ſuffering, namely, for a good cauſe, and for righteouſneſſe ſake. And we ſuffer as Chriſt ſuffered in regard of the manner of our ſuffering: we imitate and follow him in bearing the croſſe, and that meaſure of affliction that is layd on vs, as himſelfe ſpeakes, Luke 9.23. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him denie himſelfe, and take vp his croſſe daily and follow me.</hi> If we beare the croſſe, and ſuffer the afflictions the Lord layes on vs, as we haue Chriſt for our example, and as he hath borne it before vs, willingly and chearefully ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it vp, and bearing it with patience, and in obedience, and with a quiet ſubmiſſion of our wils to the good will and pleaſure of the Lord, euen to the ſhedding of our bloud for
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:492:223"/> the keeping of faith and a good conſcience, and ſo as our ſufferings may be ſaid to be <hi>Chriſt his ſufferings,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle cals them, 1. Pet. 4.13. We being therein conformable to Chriſt our head, and Chriſt accounting our ſufferings as his owne, and ſuffering in vs, as he ſaid Act. 9.4. <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> then we ſuffer with Chriſt: and that is here meant by the Apoſtle, when he ſaith, <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with him. That we may alſo be glorified with him:</hi> that is, to this end, that we may alſo in our ſoules and bodies partake with Chriſt in eternall life and glorie in heauen, and in his eternall kingdome; not in equall degree, but according to our propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2. Tim. 2.12. <hi>If we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reigne with him.</hi> So then the meaning of theſe words, <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may alſo be glorified with him,</hi> is briefly this, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We being the children of God, are heires of God, and heires an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed with Chriſt, yet ſo, as we vndergo the neceſſarie condition that we muſt vndergo; and walke in the way wherein we muſt walke to life and glorie in heauen; if ſo be that we ſuffer with Chriſt (that is) as Chriſt hath ſuffered, both in respect of the cauſe and manner of our ſuffering: and haue fellowſhip with Chriſt in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and be therein conformable to Chriſt our head; and Chriſt accounting our ſufferings as his owne, and ſuffering in vs, to this end, that we may alſo in our ſoules and bodies partake with Christ in eternall life and glorie, and in his eternall kingdome; though not in equall degree, but according to our meaſure and proportion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now firſt we are to call to mind, that theſe words, <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may alſo be glorified with him:</hi> are (as I told you) a preuention of a ſecret obiection, that ſome afflicted might make againſt the Apoſtles forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpeech. For ſome afflicted perſon, euen a child of God, might thus obiect, and would be readie thus to obiect, What, I an heire of God, and ioynt heire and fellow heire with Chriſt, that am thus poore, and thus perſecuted, and thus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and the like? This the Apoſtle preuents, by making knowne that the condition of ſuch as are heires of life and ſaluation, and of ſuch as ſhall be glorified with Chriſt, is this,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:492:223"/> that they muſt firſt ſuffer with him before they come to be glorified with him. Whence I might ſtand to ſhew, that in the holy truth of God reuealed in his word, there is anſwer to be found to any needfull doubt or queſtion that the heart of man can make or propound: but I paſſe from that, and the thing I will hence note is this.</p>
               <p>That many times Gods children being vnder afflictions, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> are driuen to doubt of Gods loue to them,<note place="margin">Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſometimes queſtion their ſtate, being vnder ſome grieuous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</note> and to queſtion their eſtate whether they be the children of God or no, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are afflicted; eſpecially if they be vnder ſome grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous affliction, then they are readie to ſay, What, I a child of God, that am thus grieuouſly afflicted? or was there euer any child of God as I am? did you euer know any child of God in the like affliction that I am now in? Theſe and the like doubts many times ariſe in the minds of Gods children in the time of their ſufferings and afflictions; and the world is readie to gather and conclude from the afflictions of Gods children, that God loues them not, and thereupon to charge it on them that they are none of Gods children. It was <hi>Iobs</hi> caſe, his friends iudged him to be but an hypocrite, becauſe of his great afflictions, as we may reade in the booke of <hi>Iob</hi> in manie places of it. Yea Satan is readie to take aduantage of the afflictions of Gods children, and thereupon to caſt doubts into their minds of Gods loue towards them, and whether they be the children of God or no. He ſet on Chriſt himſelfe, and would haue perſwaded him that he had not bene the Sonne of God, becauſe of his hunger in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Matth. 4.3.<note place="margin">Mat. 4.3.</note> 
                  <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God, command that theſe ſtones be made bread:</hi> as if he had ſaid, Art thou the Sonne of God? would God ſuffer his Sonne to be here in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, and to ſtarue for want of bread? no, no if thou wert the Sonne of God thou ſhouldſt haue bread to ſuſtaine thee in this thy need, though it were made miraculouſly of ſtones. Pſal. 73. <hi>Dauid</hi> looking on the proſperitie of the wicked, and conſidering that together with his owne afflicted eſtate, broke out verſe 13.14. and ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.13.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Certainly I haue cleanſed mine heart in vaine, and waſhed my hands in innocencie: for daily haue
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:492:224"/> I bene puniſhed, and chaſtened euerie morning.</hi> Iudg. 6.13. ſaith <hi>Gideon</hi> in the time of a publike calamitie and diſtreſſe, <hi>If the Lord be with vs, why then is all this come vpon vs?</hi> As if he had ſaid, if the Lord were with vs and did fauour vs, why then are we vnder this great affliction? Thus Gods children manie times doubt of Gods loue to them, and queſtion their eſtate whether they be Gods children or no, becauſe they be affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and eſpecially if they be grieuouſly afflicted.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> is, becauſe they ſuffer their minds too much to runne on their afflictions, and too much to muſe on them, and their hearts too much to ſettle on them, and they lay them too neare to their hearts, and they ponder too much on the worth of the good things they want: as in ſickneſſe, of the worth of health: in pouertie, of the worth of riches, and the like: and they conſider not Gods vſuall dealing with his owne deare children. And hence it comes, that many times they are brought to doubt of Gods loue towards them, and call it into queſtion whether they be Gods children or no.</p>
               <p>And for vſe, this muſt teach vs, in time of our afflictions to labour to ſtrengthen our faith in the mercie of God, <label type="milestone">

And to this purpoſe beſides this text we haue further euidence of Scripture, Mark. 10.39. Chriſt tels the ſons of <hi>Zebedeus, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> they ſhould <hi>drinke of the cup that he ſhould drinke of, and be baptized with his baptiſme that he ſhould be baptized withall,</hi> before they could come to glorie in heauen. Matth. 16.24.25. the Lord Ieſus ſaith, <hi>If any man will follow me, let him forſake himſelfe, and take vp his croſſe and follow me.</hi> For whoſoeuer will ſaue his life ſhall loſe it, and whoſoeuer ſhall loſe his life for my ſake ſhall find it. Act. 14.22. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> exhorted the diſciples to continue, affirming that <hi>through many afflictions we muſt enter into the kingdome of God:</hi> before we come to glorie in heauen we muſt paſſe through afflictions. Hebr. 12.8. the holy Ghoſt ſaith, all Gods children are partakers of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>If ye be without correction, whereof all are partakers, then are ye baſtards and not ſonnes.</hi> It is the condition that all Gods children muſt vndergo. Iam. 1.12. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth tentation, for when he is tried he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the crowne of life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them that loue him:</hi> as if he had ſaid, after his triall, and not before,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:492:225"/> he ſhall receiue the crowne of victorie. And to theſe we might adde manie other teſtimonies clearing and confirming the point in hand, that the heires of life and ſaluation muſt here in this world firſt ſuffer and beare the croſſe before they come to enioy the crowne of life and glorie in heauen, and the way in which they muſt walke to heauen is by the croſſe: and the reaſons of it are theſe.</p>

And ſo there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of ſuffering and of bearing the croſſe before we come to enioy the crowne of life and glorie in heauen, in regard of Gods appointment. Chriſt ſaith, Luk. 24.26. that he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily bound firſt to ſuffer and then to enter into his glorie, euen in regard of the will of God reuealed by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets: <hi>Ought not Chriſt to haue ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his glorie?</hi> and the members of Chriſt are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Chriſt their head.</p>

Now afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and the croſſe are a ſpeciall meanes (the Lord in wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and by his almightie power ſo diſpoſing of them) to worke that fitneſſe, euen to purge out pride, ſelfe-loue, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, couetouſneſſe, anger, and the like, and to quicken vs vp vnto all good duties; euen to make vs fit for the ſeruice of God here, and for glorie and happineſſe hereafter. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doubtleſſe on theſe grounds we may ſet downe this for a certaine truth, that the heires of life and ſaluation muſt here in this world firſt ſuffer and beare the croſſe, before they come to enioy the crowne of life and glorie in heauen: and the way in which they muſt walke to heauen, is by the croſſe and through afflictions.</p>

<pb n="441" facs="tcp:492:225"/> they are going on in the way towards heauen; and that they muſt go by weeping croſſe to the crowne of life and glorie in heauen. We may not looke to go to heauen (as the ſaying is) in a feather bed, to go to heauen with eaſe, and to walke on in an euen, ſmooth, and pleaſant way to life and glorie in heauen: no, the way in which we muſt walke to heauen is by the croſſe and through afflictions. Indeed the fleſh loues eaſe, and cannot endure to think of this condition, &amp; it grieues the fleſh that God and Mammon are no better friends: yea euerie one could be content to be <hi>Diues</hi> whileſt he liues here in this world, ſo that he might be <hi>Lazarus</hi> when he is dead, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one would willingly go to heauen, but he would walke in a conuenient broad way, as one ſaith well, in a way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he might driue a ſumpter horſe before him. Euerie one would gladly haue comfort in Chriſt, but euerie one is not willing to beare the croſſe with Chriſt. Some ſhun the croſſe by all meanes, by all ſhifts and deuices that poſſibly they can they put it off, they will not ſuffer the <hi>rebukes of Christ,</hi> as they are called, Hebr. 11.26. they will not beare diſgrace, they will not vndergo the note and odious name of Puritanes: no they will rather do as the moſt do, and ſerue the time though it be with making ſhipwracke of a good conſcience, that they may liue quietly and ſafely, and ſleepe in a whole skin: and yet they thinke they may go to heauen well enough. Alas, they deceiue themſelues, the way to heauen is by the croſſe: and thinke not whoſoeuer thou art, that thou ſhalt come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and yet eſcape the croſſe, and meete with no afflictions by the way; as the worldling by temporall glorie goes to eternall ſhame, ſo muſt thou by temporall troubles go on to eternall glorie. It is the way in which Chriſt himſelfe hath gone before thee, and all the Saints and ſeruants of God that are now in heauen haue walked on in the ſame path; and thou maiſt not thinke to make a ſhorter cut, or to find an eaſier and a plainer way to heauen then they haue found. And therefore thou that art a child of God, or doſt perſwade thy ſelfe that thou art ſo, prepare thy ſoule for afflictions, and make full rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening and full account to meete with afflictions in the way
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:492:226"/> to heauen. It is the the aduice of Chriſt himſelfe, Luk. 14.28. that with what deliberation mightie men of the world build their caſtles, or one great king goes to warre with another, with the ſame deliberation ſhould we vndertake the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſtianitie: we muſt caſt our account aforehand, what it will coſt vs, and what we ſhall meete withall in that holy profeſſion, and whether we be able to go through ſtitch with it or no. And thus do thou whoſoeuer thou art, that doſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thy ſelfe that thou art a child of God, and doſt take on thee the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and profeſſion of the Goſpell: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with thy ſelfe what troubles and croſſes thou ſhalt meete withall in that holy profeſſion, and reſolue to beare them whatſoeuer they be: ſay not with thy ſelfe out of thine owne weakeneſſe, what ſhall I do, I ſhall be made a byword, I ſhall be pointed at, or the like? Put on courage and reſolution to beare whatſoeuer ſhall attend on thy holy profeſſion; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue with thy ſelfe to go through thicke and thinne, to go through good report and ill report, to beare reproches, nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names, mockings, ſcoffings, raylings, reuilings, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpitefull dealing, euen to the ſhedding of thy bloud if thou be called to it, for keeping of faith and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and think not ſtrange the <hi>fierie triall</hi> if thou be brought to it, as 1. Pet. 4.12. and remember the words of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Luk. 14.26.27. <hi>If thou hate not father, mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and ſiſters, yea and thine owne life alſo, thou canſt not be Chriſts diſciple.</hi> And if thou beare not the croſſe and comeſt not after Chriſt, thou canſt not be his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.

                  </label> thou muſt know that the Lord calleth not all his children to the ſame kind of ſuffering, and to ſuffer in the ſame kind, neither doth he call all his children to ſuffer alike and in the ſame meaſure in the ſame kinde, but ſome to ſuffer in one kind and ſome in another, and ſome in one mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ſome in another, as he ſeeth fit in his infinite wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And if thou haue not had <hi>Abels</hi> croſſe, if thy life haue not bene ſought, and thou haſt not bene perſecuted to death; yet doubtleſſe thou being one truly fearing God, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to keepe faith and a good conſcience in all things, and walking with an euen foote in the way of holineſſe, either thou haſt not eſcaped, or thou ſhalt not eſcape <hi>Iſaacks</hi> croſſe, the ſmiting of the tongue, the mocking and ſcoffing of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Iſmael:</hi> the wicked and prophane of the world will mocke, and ſcoffe, and deride thee, and that is perſecution, ſo the Apoſtle cals it, Galat. 4.29. And know further, that if thou be prepared and readie to beare any other croſſe that ſhall be layd on thee, euen to the ſhedding of thy bloud for the keeping of faith and a good conſcience, though the Lord neuer call thee ſo to do, yet in Gods account it is all one as if thou hadſt alreadie layd downe thy life and ſhed thy bloud.<note place="margin">Note.</note>

So if thou be reſolued to lay downe thy life for Chriſt, and for the profeſſion of the Goſpell, though God

                  <hi>It is better to ſuffer with Chriſt, and with him to be vnder the croſſe, then without him to be in the greateſt proſperitie.</hi> Oh then remember this to thy comfort, thou that art a child of God, thou being vnder any affliction, and thou bearing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction in ſome meaſure as it ought to be borne, thou haſt Chriſt a fellow ſufferer with thee, and Chriſt beares vp one end of the croſſe with thee, and he is able to helpe and ſuccour thee, and ſupport thee in thy greateſt afflictions. Yea know to thy comfort, that he ſuffers with thee, who hath alreadie ſuffered for thee; thou being a member of Chriſt, his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hath remoued from thee the bitterneſſe of the croſſe, namely, the wrath of God and the curſe, he hath borne that in his owne bodie and ſoule; yea he alone, as Iſai. 63.3. <hi>I haue troden the winepreſſe alone:</hi> and he hath remoued that from thee, and by his ſuffering he hath ſweetned thy croſſe and thy afflictions: yet in that affliction thou lieſt vnder, ſo ſweetened to thee, is he pleaſed to beare a part, and as it were to put vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſhoulder, and to ſuffer with thee: and what an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent comfort is that, if it be duly conſidered? Let euery child of God thinke on it to his comfort in time of his affliction, and ſo much alſo of that.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle addes a ground of further comfort againſt the bitterneſſe of the croſſe, that we ſuffering with Chriſt, our ſuffering ſhall end in glorie with Chriſt. <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may alſo be glorified with him.</hi> The point hence offered, wherein I will likewiſe be briefe, is <label type="milestone">

               <p>That the ſufferings and afflictions of Gods children ſhall haue a comfortable end,<note place="margin">The ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>flictions of Gods children ſhal end moſt happily and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably.</note> they ſhall end in happineſſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie euerlaſting with Chriſt in heauen, yea the ſufferings of Gods children ſhall end in correſpondent and anſwerable glorie. The more Gods children ſuffer here in this world (ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering as they ought to do) the more and greater ſhall be
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:492:229"/> their glorie in heauen. Pſal. 126.5. <hi>Dauid</hi> compares the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of Gods children to <hi>ſowing in teares,</hi> and he ſaith, the harueſt that ſhal come on that ſowing ſhall be ſweet &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, euen <hi>a reaping in ioy: they that ſow in teares ſhall reape in ioy.</hi> Mat. 19.29.

               <p>The ground of this is, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> becauſe it is a iuſt thing with the Lord, to giue his children after their toyles and troubles in ſuffering here in the world, eaſe, and reſt, and refreſhing, and ioy, and glorie: I ſay, a iuſt thing it is with the Lord thus to deale with them, not for any merit of their ſuffering, but in regard of his free promiſe, he hauing bound himſelfe by his promiſe, to recompence their afflictions, and ſufferings, and trials. 2. Theſ. 1.6.7. the Apoſtle ſaith in expreſſe termes: <hi>It is a righteous thing with God, to recompence tribulation to them that trouble his children, and to his children that are troubled reſt and refreſhing.</hi> And to this purpoſe Chriſt brings in <hi>Abraham</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the parable, Luke 16.25. <hi>Sonne, remember that in thy life time thou receiuedſt thy pleaſures, or good things, and Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus paines, now therefore is he comforted and thou art tormented.</hi> As if he had ſaid, now it is iuſt and equall, that he ſhould be comforted and thou tormented.</p>
               <p>Come we to make vſe of this truth: It ſerues as a ſpeciall <label type="milestone">

<pb n="450" facs="tcp:492:230"/> meanes to cheare them vp, and to keepe them from fainting in their greateſt afflictions and ſufferings: for as the ſaying is, that is well that ends well; and certainly it ſhall be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding well, yea vnſpeakably, and vnconceiueably well with Gods children concerning the end of their afflictions: though the bearing and ſuffering of them be very painefull and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous to the fleſh and for the time, yet the end of them will be moſt glorious, happie, and comfortable, they ſhall certainly end in happineſſe and glorie with Chriſt in heauen. And doubtleſſe the conſideration of this, made the holy Martyrs go with reioycing and ſinging through the flames of fire, and with chearefulneſſe to endure moſt exquiſite torments. Some of them haue ſaid when they were going to be put to death, <hi>Though their breakefaſt ſhould be ſower, yet their ſupper ſhould be most ſweet.</hi> It is recorded of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that when he was caſt to the wilde beaſts to be deuoured, he ſaid: <hi>Becauſe I am the Lords wheat, I ſhall be ground in the teeth of the beaſts, that I may be made fit bread for the Lords table.</hi> A ſpeech full of conſtant boldneſſe and heauenly comfort. And we reade of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Heb. 11.26. that he <hi>eſteemed the rebukes of Chriſt greater riches then the treaſures of Egypt.</hi> And why? he had reſpect vnto the reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence of the reward, he had an eye to the end of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and knew that the end would be moſt ſweete.

And this the Apoſtle doth not ſimplie affirme, but he propounds his argument vnder a compariſon of things vnequall, comparing the afflictions of this life with the glorie of the life to come, as the leſſe with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as that the glorie of the life to come doth farre ſurmount and exceed all the afflictions and ſufferings of this life, and that the afflictions of this life cannot hold weight with the glorie of the life to come; and if they ſhould be weighed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as in a ballance, the one would be found but light in reſpect of the other: <hi>The afflictions of this preſent time,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>are not worthie of the glorie which ſhall be</hi>
                  <pb n="452" facs="tcp:492:231"/> ſhewed vnto vs, they are not comparable vnto it. And herein alſo the Apoſtle preuents a ſecret obiection; for ſome might ſay to him, You tell vs that we ſuffering with Chriſt we ſhall be glorified with him, but in the meane time we lye vnder grieuous troubles, and verie ſore afflictions, our trials and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings here in this world are intollerable, and who is able to endure the troubles that do befall vs? This the Apoſtle meets withall, in ſaying, <hi>That the afflictions of this preſent time, are not worthie of the glorie which ſhall be ſhewed vnto vs,</hi> that ſhall be reuealed vnto vs. As if he had ſaid, though your afflictions and ſufferings in this preſent life be great, and grieuous, and ſore, and hard to be borne and endured, yet beare them with as much patience as poſſibly you can, and know to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that the glorie which is to follow on your afflictions is farre greater and more laſting then be your afflictions, there is no compariſon betweene them. And this the Apoſtle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes as a truth whereof he was reſolued, as a certaine truth, in his iudgement, in his account and eſtimation. <hi>For I count</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the afflictions of this preſent time are not worthie of the glorie which ſhall be ſhewed vnto vs.</hi> And ſo we ſee the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall drift and purpoſe of the Apoſtle in this verſe, and the generall matter of it: I will now lay foorth the ſence and meaning of the words.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>For I collect and gather, and that firmely, I conclude and reſolue on this as a certaine truth, that the paſſions and ſufferings of this life, euen all troubles, trials, and croſſes that we or any of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do beare during the time of this life, and whileſt we liue here on the face of the earth, are not of equall weight, are not in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect proportionable to the heauenly glorie wherewith our bodies and ſoules ſhall be inueſted, and that ſhall be put on them at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt; there is no compariſon betweene them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we ſee the Apoſtle here deliuers not this truth, that the afflictions of this preſent time are not worthie of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which ſhall be ſhewed vnto vs, as an vncertaine opinion, but as a certaine truth, and a truth whereof he was fully reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

And to this purpoſe that is a cleare text, 2.

And from
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:492:232"/> thoſe words of the Apoſtle we may gather reaſons &amp; grounds of this truth, that the ſuffering of Gods children in this world are not comparable or proportionable to the glorie that ſhall be put on them in heauen. As</p>

Corinth. 12.4. the Apoſtle ſaith, he being <hi>rapt vp into Paradiſe, he heard words vnutterable, and not poſſible for man to vtter.</hi> And we reade that <hi>Peter</hi> being preſent at the transfiguration of Chriſt, and hauing but a glimſe of heauenly glorie, he was ſo ouerwhelmed with it, as that he <hi>ſpake he knew not what,</hi> ſaith the text, Matth. 9.6. And therefore doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe on theſe grounds this ſtands as a firme and certaine truth, that all the afflictions Gods children do or can ſuffer in this world, are not comparable to the glorie of heauen; that glorie doth euerie way ſurmount them, and there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon betweene them.</p>
               <p>And for the vſe, firſt this truth ouerturnes that conceit of the Papiſts, that the ſufferings of Gods children in this world <label type="milestone">

And therefore thou that art a child of God, meditate and thinke on this; if thou lyeſt vnder ſome grieuous affliction, remember that thy ſufferings here in this world be they neuer ſo great, are not comparable to the glorie of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; and it will be a notable meanes to cheare thee vp, and to comfort thee. Haply thou complaineſt of thy long lingring ſickneſſe and paine, thy bodie being vnder ſickneſſe and paine: and take a man in a burning feuer, and you ſhall heare him vtter ſuch words, and ſo proteſt of his paine as if it were vnſufferable: but what is that paine to eternitie of ioy and glorie in heauen? it is not worthie to be named with it: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them together, and thou ſhalt find it will mitigate thy paine, and it will yeeld thee comfort in thy greateſt pangs.
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:492:233"/> A diſeaſed man or woman we know will endure cutting, and ſearing, and the like, in conſideration of eaſe afterwards: and comparing that paine with the eaſe he hopes will follow, he endures cutting and ſeating with patience: ſo do thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the paine of thy ſuffering with the ioy and glorie in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and it will certainly ſwallow vp thy paine, and yeeld thee much comfort. If we were as apprehenſiue of the greatneſſe of the glorie of heauen abiding for vs, as we are apprehenſiue of the paine of our preſent ſufferings, without queſtion it would make vs beare them exceeding patiently. <label type="milestone">

               <p>Now in the next place, obſerue how the Apoſtle limits the afflictions of Gods children, he cals the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the afflictions of this preſent time, or of the time that is now: <hi>I count that the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this preſent time are not worthie of the glorie which ſhall be ſhewed vnto vs.</hi> And hence we are giuen to vnderſtand thus <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct </seg>2</label> much.</p>
               <p>That the afflictions of Gods children are but of ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,<note place="margin">Though the afflictions of Gods children be bitter and ſharpe, yet they are but of ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</note> and they laſt but a while. Though the afflictions of Gods children be bitter and ſharpe, yet they are but momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie and ſhort, and they endure but for the time of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, they determine and end in death, and death puts an
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:492:234"/> end to them all, and ſo they are but ſhort and momentanie. And thus the Apoſtle ſpeakes of them expreſly in the place before cited, 2. Corinth. 4.17. he there ſaith, the afflictions that he and other true beleeuers endured, were but light and momentany, but for a mement, <hi>Our light affliction which is but for a moment, cauſeth vnto vs a far more excellent and an eternall weight of glorie.</hi> And ſo alſo ſpeakes the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> of the afflictions of Gods children, 1. Pet. 5.10. <hi>After that ye haue ſuffered a little,</hi> ſaith he, after your ſuffering which is but ſhort, and for a little time. And on this ground doth the Author to the Hebrewes cheare vp the beleeuing Hebrewes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to a patient bearing of their great afflictions. Hebr. 10.37. he tels them, their afflictions ſhould laſt but for a verie little while, and the Lord Ieſus would ſhortly come and put an end to them, <hi>Yet a verie little while</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and he that ſhall come will come, and will not tarrie.</hi> Hence is the time of the afflictions of Gods children called in Scripture ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>houre of tentation,</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>day of affliction,</hi> as Eccleſ. 7.16. <hi>In the day of wealth be of good comfort, and in the day of affliction conſider:</hi> to note the ſhortneſſe of that time, that it is but as an houre, or as a day. And it is worth our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to this purpoſe that we finde, Iſai. 54.8.<note place="margin">Iſai. 54.8.</note> the Lord there ſpeaking by his Prophet of the 70. yeares captiuitie of his people, he cals it <hi>but a moment,</hi> and a little ſeaſon, <hi>For a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in mine anger, I hid my face from thee for a little ſeaſon, but with euerlaſting mercie haue I had compaſſion on thee, ſaith the Lord thy redeemer.</hi> And indeed if a child of God ſhould lye vnder the afflicting hand of God from his birth to his death, admit he liue the full age of a man, yet it is but for a while, and for a ſhort time; for the dayes of our life here are but few, our time in this world is but ſhort: our life is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a vapour, to a ſhadow, to a bubble, to a blaſt of wind, to a watch in the night, and to many other things of ſhort continuance: it is ſaid to be but as <hi>an hand breadth,</hi> or as a <hi>ſpan long,</hi> Pſal. 39.5. And therefore the afflictions of Gods children laſting no longer then the time of this preſent life, and death putting an end to them, as indeed it doth, the holy Ghoſt
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:492:234"/> ſaith, Reuel. 14.13. <hi>When death comes, they reſt from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and from all their paines, miſeries, and ſufferings:</hi> it muſt needs be that they are but ſhort and momentanie, and they laſt but a while.</p>
               <p>Now for the vſe, firſt this truth diſcouers a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> the ſufferings of Gods children and the ſufferings of the wicked and reprobates.<note place="margin">A difference betweene the ſufferings of Gods children and the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the wicked, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</note> The ſufferings of Gods children are but ſhort and momentanie, they laſt no longer then the time of this life, death puts an end to them: but the ſufferings of the wicked and reprobate are of longer continuance, they are not onely ſufferings of this preſent life, and ſuch as are cut off and determined by death, no, no, the wicked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate do by death enter into endleſſe woe and euerlaſting ſufferings, their ſufferings are but here begun, and they ſhall laſt for euer. And therefore thou that art a wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane wretch, when the hand of God is heauie on thee, and thou art vnder ſome grieuous paine and torment, thinke not that death ſhall put an end to thy torment, as many times wicked and prophane miſcreants do: they lying vnder grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous torments, they wiſh they might dye, and ſay, oh that I were dead and out of this world, then I ſhould be out of my paine. Poore ſoules, they are deceiued, death to them is but an entrance into endleſſe torments. And know it whoſoeuer thou art, that art a graceleſſe and prophane wretch, thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnder ſome grieuous torment and paine, and hauing a feeling of thy torment and paine, and yet hauing no feeling of thy vileneſſe and ſinne to be humbled for it, the Lord hath but begun to ſit in iudgement againſt thee, and thy preſent torment and paine (thou ſtill continuing in thy vileneſſe and ſinne) is but a pledge of more fearefull torments, paines, and ſufferings yet to come, and it is but a <hi>beginning of ſorrow,</hi> Mat. 24.8. It is but a beginning of thine eternall woe and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſuffering.</p>
               <p>Againe, for a ſecond vſe, is it ſo that the afflictions of Gods <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> children are but momentanie and ſhort,<note place="margin">What Gods children are to conſider to their comfort in time of their bitter and ſharpe afflictions.</note> and they laſt no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then this preſent life, and death puts an end to them? Here is then ground and matter of comfort for thee that art a child
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:492:235"/> of God in the time of thy greateſt afflictions and ſufferings: though thy afflictions be bitter and ſharpe, yet conſider this to thy comfort, they are but ſhort, and they ſhall laſt but for a while. And the heathen man could ſay: that ſhort euils though they be great and bitter, yet they are more tollerable becauſe they are ſhort. And therefore thou that art a child of God, thinke on this to thy comfort when thou lyeſt vnder ſome grieuous affliction; yea conſider with thy ſelfe, thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is neuer ſo grieuous but the Lord vouchſafeth thee ſome intermiſſion, he giues thee ſome breathing, and ſome refreſhing in it, as he ſaith, Iſai. 57.16. <hi>I will not contend for euer, neither will I be alwayes wrath, for the ſpirit ſhould faile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and I haue made the breath.</hi> Yea conſider that thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is meaſured out to thee by the good hand of thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father, who will be ſure to keepe a meaſure, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, 1. Cor. 10.13. And though it be ſo that thou art vnder ſome great affliction all thy life long, yet cheare vp thy ſelfe with this, thy life is not long, and ſo thy affliction can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long endure: when death ſhall come and cut off the thread of thy life, it ſhall alſo put an end to all thy afflictions. And be it ſo that thou art vnder the hand of bloudie perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and cruell tormentors, yet conſider that either thy perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors and tormentors may die, their breath may faile them, or the inſtruments and meanes of thy trouble and torment may be interrupted, and broken, and faile, the rod that is on thy backe may be waſted: and the Lord hath ſaid, Pſal. 125.3. <hi>The rod of the wicked ſhall not rest on the lot of the righteous:</hi> or thy ſelfe may die, and be taken out of their hands by death, and they can then put thee to no further paine nor torment. And therefore as Chriſt ſaith, Math. 10.28. <hi>Feare not them that can kill the bodie,</hi> that can onely torment thy bodie, and that onely during the time of this life, and when this life is ended, can go no further. Conſider that as thou doſt ſuffer daily, ſo thou art <hi>dying daily,</hi> and that which thy perſecutors do afflict, is but thy bodie, and thy bodie is drawing to corruption and death, and death ſhall exempt thee and ſet thee free from all their tyrannie. Thus make thy aduantage of thy mortalitie,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:492:235"/> thou that art a child of God, and remember when thou lyeſt vnder any great and ſore affliction, thy affliction ſhall laſt no longer then the time of this life, death ſhall put an end to it, and it is but as one ſaith of <hi>Iulians</hi> perſecution, <hi>Nubecula citò tranſitura,</hi> as a ſtorme that ſhall ſoone be ouerblowne, and then will follow an euerlaſting calme, euen an euerlaſting freedome and reſt from all ſorrowes, and griefes, and paines, and ſufferings: and thinke on that to thy comfort.</p>
               <p>There is yet one thing to be further noted in this reaſon, I will but touch it in a word. The Apoſtle here ſpeaking of the glorie that ſhall be put on Gods children in heauen, he ſaith, the glorie that ſhall be ſhewed, or that ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed to vs.</p>
               <p>The point hence is this. That the time ſhall come when <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> the glorie that belongs to Gods children ſhall be openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed, and be made manifeſt in the view of men and Angels.<note place="margin">Gods children ſhall one day be glorious in the ſight, both of men and Angels.</note> And to this purpoſe ſpeakes the Apoſtle, Coloſ. 3.4. <hi>When Chriſt which is our life ſhall appeare,</hi> when he ſhall appeare to iudge the world, <hi>and come in his glorie,</hi> as it is Math. 25.31. <hi>Then ſhall we alſo appeare with him in glorie,</hi> euen clothed with vnſpeakable glorie, in our ſoules, and in our bodies. 1. Ioh. 3.2. ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn, Dearely beloued, we are now the ſonnes of God, yet it doth not appeare what we ſhall be, and we know that when we ſhall appeare we ſhall be like him.</hi> We ſhall then be like the Lord Ieſus in glorie, and then the glorie that is reſerued for vs in heauen, ſhall be put on vs, and ſhall then openly appeare: and not to adde further teſtimonie.</p>
               <p>The reaſon <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> and ground of this is, becauſe there muſt be a time when the moſt wicked ſhall iuſtifie Gods goodneſſe and mercie, and his gracious dealing towards his children. Now in this world they ſee the troubles and afflictions of Gods children, and they ſee not the beautie and glorie of their ſoules, for that is inward and ſpirituall, as it is ſaid of the Church, Pſal. 45.13. <hi>She is all glorious within,</hi> and that is not diſcerned with carnall eyes: and ſo the world looking on Gods children here, they ſee not their beautie and glorie, but onely ſee their afflictions and troubles, and thereupon they
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:492:236"/> iudge them to be wretched &amp; miſerable; and therefore there muſt be a time when the glorie that belongeth to them ſhall be openly reuealed, and ſet before the eyes of all the world, that euen the moſt wicked may looke on it, and be forced to iuſtifie Gods goodneſſe and mercie towards his children, and his gracious dealing with them.</p>
               <p>Now this for vſe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> may ſerue as a ground of great comfort to Gods children:<note place="margin">A ground of great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to Gods children.</note> for what though it be ſo that their beautie and glorie be here in this world ouerſhadowed and hid from the eye of the world, and of ſuch as looke on them with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall eyes, yet let them waite in patience for a time, and the time ſhall come when their glorie ſhall manifeſtly appeare, and be open to the view of the whole world; yea the time ſhall come when men and Angels ſhall ſee it, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it with admiration; yea the time ſhall come when thoſe who haue here <hi>turned their glorie into ſhame,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeakes, Pſal. 4.2. that is, haue here reproched them for their holy and religious courſe (which indeed is their glorie,) and layd that on them as a reproch, and loaded them with odious and ſoule names in reſpect of that, ſhall ſee that which now they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count their ſhame crowned with glorie, and ſhall be forced to change their note, and to crie out and ſay: Ah, we fooles thought the life of theſe men or women baſe, and full of diſhonour, and now behold their vnſpeakable brightneſſe and glorie, now it appeares to the view of all the world.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe verſes the Apoſtle further proues, that the glorie that ſhall be put on Gods children in heauen, ſhall be exceeding great and weightie. For hauing ſaid verſe before, that the heauenly glory that ſhall be ſhewed or reuealed to Gods children, doth farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed their preſent ſufferings, he here confirmes that propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he here further proues, that the glorie where with Gods children ſhall be inueſted in heauen, is both exceeding great, and alſo moſt ſure and certaine, that it ſhall be both great glorie, and alſo certaine glorie, and to that purpoſe he brings two arguments. The firſt is from the expectation of the creature, that the creature doth expect and looke for it, that the creature doth waite for the manifeſtation of that glorie. And the ſecond is from the expectation of ſuch as haue the firſt fruites of the Spirit, that they alſo expect and looke for it, and waite for it: and that which both the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by ſecret inſtinct of nature, and alſo the godly by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of grace, and the motion of Gods Spirit, do expect, and looke for, and waite for, muſt needs be both great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and alſo moſt ſure and certaine.</p>
               <p>Now the firſt argument of the Apoſtle is layd downe verſe
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:492:237"/> 19. and that not barely, but with amplification, from the manner how the creature waites for the reuelation of the ſonnes of God, as namely, that it is with earneſt and feruent deſire after it.<note place="margin">Verſe 19.</note> 
                  <hi>The feruent deſire of the creature,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>waiteth when the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then in the two verſes following he bringeth two reaſons why the creature doth with earneſt and feruent deſire waite for the reuelation of the ſonnes of God, as firſt in verſe 20.<note place="margin">Verſe 20.</note> he brings a reaſon from the preſent ſtate and hard condition of the creature, that the creature is now for the preſent ſubiect to vanitie, and therefore waiteth when the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed. Which ſubiection is further ſet forth, the Apoſtle explaning how the creature is ſubiect to vanitie, that is, <hi>not of it owne will,</hi> but from another cauſe, <hi>by reaſon of him which hath ſubdued it.</hi> Whereunto the Apoſtle adioynes hope of deliuerance, and ſaith, <hi>By reaſon of him which hath ſubdued it vnder hope:</hi> and ſo he falleth on the ſecond reaſon, why the creature doth with feruent deſire waite for the reuelation of the ſonnes of God, verſe 21.<note place="margin">Verſe 21.</note> which is taken from the future better eſtate of the creature, as that the creature ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from the preſent hard condition to a better ſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the creature alſo ſhall be deliuered (the Apoſtle expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from what, namely, from bondage) from the bondage of corruption. And whereunto it ſhall be reſtored: Into the glorious libertie of the ſonnes of God. And then verſe 22.<note place="margin">Verſe 22.</note> the Apoſtle concludeth his argument, by ſetting downe the greatneſſe of the bondage the creature is ſubiect to; that it is ſo great, as it doth (as it were an heauie burthen) preſſe downe the creature, and make it grone vnder the weight of it, and as it were trauell in paine vnder it for deliuerance. Yea the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Euery creature is vnder this great bondage, and grones, and trauels in paine, together one with another, and that to this houre:</hi> that is, to this preſent: and further ſetteth out that as a thing commonly knowne, <hi>We know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that euery creature groneth with vs alſo, and trauelleth in paine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto this preſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond argument that the Apoſtle bringeth to proue
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:492:237"/> that the glorie that ſhall be reuealed on Gods children in heauen, is both great and ſure, from the expectation of ſuch as haue the firſt fruites of the Spirit, is layd downe verſe 23.<note place="margin">Verſe 23.</note> I will lay forth that argument when I come to the handling of that verſe.</p>
               <p>Come we now to ſtand on theſe verſes as they lie in order. Verſe 19. <hi>For the feruent deſire of the creature waiteth when the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> I will firſt open the ſence and meaning of the words of the 19. verſe. <hi>For the feruent deſire of the creature.</hi> What is here meant by <hi>the creature,</hi> doth much trouble interpreters, I will labour to giue you that ſence of it that is moſt agreeable to the context and to other places of Scripture. And by <hi>the creature,</hi> here we are not to vnderſtand reaſonable creatures, men or Angels, good or bad: for the good Angels they are not ſubiect to vanitie, and vnder the bondage of corruption as the creature is the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh of. And as for bad Angels &amp; wicked men, they long not for the time when the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed. And of good men the Apoſtle ſpeakes verſe 23. expreſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing them from the creature whereof he ſpeaketh: <hi>Not onely the creature, but we alſo which haue the firſt fruites of the Spirit,</hi> ſaith he: But by <hi>the creature,</hi> here is meant the whole frame of the world, conſiſting of the coeleſtiall and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementarie region, as reuerend <hi>Beza</hi> expoundeth it, that is, the viſible heauens with all their goodly furniture, of ſtarres, and of celeſtiall bodies, and the earth with her ornaments, and the other elements.

                  </gap> is very ſignificant, it ſignifieth the looking for of ſome perſon, or of ſome thing, with lifting vp of the head, or ſtretching out of the necke, or putting forth the head, and ſetting out of the eyes, with earneſt intention and obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſee when that perſon or that thing ſhould appeare; as a man looketh for the coming of a ſpeciall friend, whoſe companie he much deſires and lookes for: hauing a promiſe of his coming, he getteth him vp to the top of the houſe, or ſome turret or high place, and he putteth forth his head, and he looketh this way, and he looketh that way, and he ſetteth his eyes on the way that his friend is to come, to ſee if he can eſpie him coming, wiſhing and deſiring his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; that is the weight of the word here vſed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, as if he had ſaid: The creature doth earneſtly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, as it were with ſtretching out of the necke, or thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting forth of the head, expect and waite when the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed. Now this expectation here aſcribed to the creature, is nothing elſe but the ſecret inſtinct which God hath put into the creatures, whereby it doth after a manner vnknowne to vs, as it were long and deſire that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect eſtate in which it was firſt made and created: euen to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that perfection from which it is fallen, and from which it is withheld through the ſinne of man: the creature tendeth to that perfection by a naturall inſtinct and propenſion, as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie things by naturall propenſion moue downewards, and light thing moue vpwards. And that is the deſire and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the creature the Apoſtle here meanes when he ſaith, <hi>The feruent deſire of the creature waiteth on or expecteth,</hi> not that the creature knowes when the ſonnes of God ſhould be reuealed, but becauſe when the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed, that is, when both the perſons of Gods children, and alſo the glorie that belongeth to them, ſhall be put on them, ſhall be made manifeſt. Thus then conceiue we the meaning of the Apoſtle in the words of this verſe, as if he had ſaid:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the whole frame of the world, euen the viſible heauens,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:492:238"/> with all their goodly furniture, the ſtarres and celestiall bodies, the bodie of the earth with her ornaments, and other elements do, by a ſecret inſtinct which God hath put into them, after a manner vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to vs, as it were long for and deſire that the originall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in which they were first made and created, from which they are fallen and withheld through the ſinne of man, which ſhall be reſtored to them when the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed: and ſo they do continually and earneſtly, as it were with ſtretched out neckes, and thrusting forth of their heads, expect and waite when both the perſons of Gods children, and alſo their glorie, euen the glorie that belongeth to them, and ſhall be put on them, ſhall be made manifeſt, and ſhall appeare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now (as I ſhewed) theſe words, <hi>The feruent deſire of the creature waiteth when the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed,</hi> are brought by the Apoſtle as an argument to proue both the greatneſſe and the certaintie of the glorie that ſhall be put on Gods children in heauen, that it ſhall be both great glorie, and alſo moſt ſure and certaine glorie, becauſe the creature, the whole frame of the world, doth expect and waite for the manifeſtation of it. So reaſoneth the Apoſtle: <hi>I count,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the afflictions of this preſent time, are not worthy of the glorie which ſhall be ſhewed vnto vs:</hi> and then he ſubioynes as a proofe and confirmation of that: <hi>For the feruent deſire of the creature waiteth when the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed.</hi> We ſee then, which is the point I will ſtand on,</p>

               <p>In the next place obſerue we, that the Apoſtle doth not here barely affirme, that the creature waiteth when the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed, but he ſets it forth with this am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification, that it waites with a feruent and with an earneſt deſire, that the creature (as we ſhewed) doth as it were with ſtretching out of the necke, and thruſting out the head, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen earneſtly and continually waite and expect when the ſons of God ſhall be reuealed.

               <p>That the verie dumbe creature hath that good in it in a <label type="milestone">

But manie men and women in the world, being wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vngodly perſons, they ſhrinke in and draw in their heads at the remembrance of that day when the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed, and when they ſhall appeare clothed with heauenly glorie; they haue no deſire in them at all to ſee that day: no, wicked perſons wiſh in their hearts that that day might neuer come, it troubles them to thinke of that day, or to heare of it, the hearing of it torments them before the time, as the diuels ſaid to Chriſt, Matth. 8.29. and they put it farre away from them in their apprehenſion, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith of the wicked of his time, Amos 6.3. <hi>They put farre away the euill day,</hi> (for ſo they count the day when the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed) and it ſhall ſo proue to them, they going on in their ſinnes without repentance, and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch to the ſeate of iniquitie.

But what knoweſt thou, whoſoeuer thou art, whether one that differs from thee in iudgement in ſome particular, being not of ſuch weight, be a deare child of God or no?

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this verſe, as I haue ſhewed, the Apoſtle yeelds a reaſon why the creature waiteth with feruent deſire for the reuelation of the children of God, taken from the preſent hard condition of the creature, in that it is ſubiect to vanitie, and therefore it waites. The Apoſtle further ſetting forth how the creature is ſubiect to vanitie, namely, <hi>not of it owne will,</hi> but from another cauſe, <hi>from the will of him who hath ſubdued it vnder hope,</hi> thereunto adioyning hope of deliuerance: <hi>Not of it owne will, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of him, which hath ſubdued it vnder hope.</hi> We did before thus analiſe &amp; reſolue this verſe, I wil now labor to open the ſence and meaning of it. <hi>Becauſe the creature is ſubiect to vanitie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> By <hi>creature</hi> we are to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, as we did verſe before, the whole
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:492:244"/> frame of the viſible world, the viſible heauens with all their goodly furniture of ſtarres and celeſtiall bodies, and the earth with all her ornaments and other elements, <hi>Is ſubiect, or is brought vnder, or put vnder (vanitie.)</hi> The word <hi>vanitie</hi> hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe exceptions in Scripture, but to giue that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to this place, it is here vſed in oppoſition to that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall, perfect, and excellent ſtate and condition in which the creature was firſt made and created, and the creature is fallen from that excellent and perfect ſtate and condition, and it is now brought vnder vanitie, and therefore it is ſaid to waite for the reuelation of the ſonnes of God, and as it were to deſire and long after that originall and perfect ſtate and condition, to be reſtored to it againe. So then vnder the word <hi>vanitie,</hi> two things are ſignified. Firſt, that the creature is now fallen from that originall, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant, &amp; durable ſtate it had in the firſt creation, and is now vnder a fleeting, fraile, and vaniſhing ſtate and condition, and now ſubiect to corruption, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith in the next verſe. Now the heauens, the earth, and the elements are ſubiect to mutabilitie, to alteration and change, and to be diſſolued. Pſal. 102.26. the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>The heauens ſhall periſh, and they ſhall waxe old as doth a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Lord ſhall change them as a veſture, and they ſhall be changed.</hi> And 2. Pet. 3.11. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That all theſe things muſt be diſſolued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, vnder the word <hi>vanitie</hi> is ſignified, that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is now fallen from that conſtant courſe it held before the fall of man, in attaining the end for which it was created, namely, to ſerue for the good of man, and that in the good vſe of it, the goodneſſe of God might by man be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and magnified, and is now vnder weakeneſſe, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to faile in attaining that end. The earth is now vnder the curſe of the Lord laid on it for the ſinne of man. Geneſ. 3.17, 18. <hi>Curſed is the earth for thy ſake, thornes and thiſtles ſhall it bring forth to thee:</hi> Yea the heauens are now ſubiect to haue their light obſcured, and their ſweet influence reſtrained, as the Sunne and Moone to be eclipſed, the skie to be ouercaſt with clouds, the ſtarres with their influence to infect the aire,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:492:244"/> the aire to become vnwholeſome and peſtiferous, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the bodies of men and beaſts. Yea the creature is now ſo farre from holding on a conſtant courſe in attaining the end for which it was made, as it is now ſubiect to be peruerted, and to be abuſed, as to ſerue the wicked and vngodly, the Sunne to giue his light, and the earth her fruite, to them who haue neither hearts nor mouthes open to praiſe God for the ſame. Yea the creature is now ſubiect oftentimes to ſerue the wicked luſts and ſinfull deſires of the vngodly, as the Lord often complaines by his Prophets. Ezech. 16.17, 18, 19. the Lord ſaith, <hi>His people had taken their faire iewels made of his gold and his ſiluer which he had giuen them, and made to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues images of men, and had committed whoredome with them; and tooke their broidered garments and couered them, and had ſet his oyle and his perfume before them: and his meate, floure, oyle, and honie, wherewith he had fed them, they ſet it before them for a ſweete ſauour.</hi> They had thus peruerted and abuſed the good creatures of God, and made them ſerue their owne vile luſts. And ſo is the creature ſubiect to vanitie, both in regard of the fraile, fleeting, and vaniſhing ſtate and condition it lyeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and alſo in regard of the weakeneſſe it is ſubiect to, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now ſubiect to faile in attaining the end for which it was created and made, in ſeruing for the good of man, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently for the praiſe and glorie of God. <hi>Not of it owne will</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeakes here figuratiuely, aſcribing a will to the dumbe and ſenſleſſe creature; and his meaning is not of the naturall inſtinct and propenſion put into the creature in the firſt creation, for euery thing hath in it a naturall propenſitie to preſerue it ſelfe, and by nature it ſhunneth the corruption and deſtruction of it ſelfe. <hi>But by reaſon of him,</hi> that is, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the will and power of God the Creator, who ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued it for the ſinne of man. <hi>Vnder hope:</hi> Here likewiſe the Apoſtle aſcribes hope to the dumbe and ſenſleſſe creature fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiuely: and his meaning is, vnder expectation of a better ſtate and condition, and ſo as it doth as it were expect and waite for a better ſtate and condition hereafter. Thus then conceiue we the meaning of the words of this verſe, as if the
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:492:245"/> Apoſtle had ſaid:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe the creature we ſpake of, namely, the whole frame of the viſible world, the viſible heauens with all their goodly furniture, and the earth with all her ornaments, are now vnder a fleeting, fraile, and vaniſhing ſtate and condition, are now ſubiect to muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, alteration, change, and diſſolution, and are now alſo vnder weakeneſſe, and ſubiect to faile in attaining the end for which they were first created, namely, to ſerue for the good of man, and that in the good vſe of them Gods goodneſſe might by man be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and manifeſted, and are now ſubiect to ſerue the wicked and vngodly, and by them to be peruerted and abuſed to ſerue their wicked luſts, not of any naturall inſtinct and propenſion put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in the firſt creation, but by reaſon of the will and power of God the Creator, who hath ſo ſubdued them for the ſinne of man, yet ſo as they do as it were expect and waite for a better ſtate and condition hereafter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in that the Apoſtle yeeldeth this as a reaſon, why the dumbe and ſenſleſſe creature waites with feruent deſire when the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed, becauſe it is ſubiect to vanitie, I might ſtand to ſhew that the vanitie and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the creature lieth vnder, makes it (as it were) deſire and long after freedome and deliuerance, but of that we ſhall ſpeake more fully afterwards.</p>
               <p>And firſt the Apoſtle affirming this by the creature, that it is ſubiect to vanitie, he giueth vs to vnderſtand thus much: in the firſt place we are to take notice of this.</p>

We reade in the booke of the Preacher, that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaking out of his owne experience, he pronounceth of all things in this world, that they are but vanitie and vexation of ſpirit, Eccleſ. 1.2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>anitie of vanities,</hi> ſaith the Preacher, <hi>vanitie of vanities, all is vanitie.</hi> And Chap. 2. he ſaith, hauing giuen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to take pleaſure in pleaſant things, hauing made great workes, built goodly houſes, planted vineyards, gardens, and orchyards, and planted in them trees of all fruite, and hauing gathered ſiluer and gold, and the chiefe treaſures of kings, and prouinces: and ſo he goeth on, and concludes verſe 11. <hi>He looked on all his workes that his hands had wrought, and the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell that he had laboured to do, and he found all was but vanitie, and vexation of ſpirit.</hi> And in the Pſalme before cited, Pſal. 102. the Pſalmiſt ſaith expreſly, that <hi>the viſible heauens ſhall periſh, and ſhall waxe old as doth a garment, and they ſhall be changed:</hi> The very heauens are lyable to corruption and diſſolution, and much more the earth and other things vnder the heauens: and common experience teacheth the truth of this. We ſee with our eyes, there be continuall alterations and changes in the face of the skie, in the aire, in the waters, and in the earth, and the beſt and moſt ſolid creatures are ſubiect to rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and putrefaction.

Ioh. 2.15. Not to loue the world, neither the things that are in the world, nor to ſuffer our hearts to cleaue to the beſt creatures here in the world, and to thinke to find happineſſe in them. Indeed we are not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the creatures that are in the world, and wilfully to caſt them from vs, as Popiſh votaries do, for they be the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of God; ſo we ſhall ſhew our ſelues vnthankfull to God: but we muſt take heed we reſt not on them, nor truſt in them, and that we thinke not to find true happineſſe in them. It is the manner of men and women that want grace, to place happineſſe in the abundance of the good things of this life. If they be poore and want grace, when they ſpeake of a wealthie man, they commonly ſay he is a happie man, he cannot do amiſſe, he hath the world at will.

Yea they thinke they haue a perpetuitie in their goods, and as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, Pſal. 49.11. <hi>They thinke their houſes ſhall continue for euer, and they call their lands after their owne names.</hi> Thus fooliſh men that want grace, and haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them but nature; yea ſuch as haue grace, and are the children of God, haue their hearts many times too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with the things of this world, and they ſuffer their hearts too much to cleaue to them, and too much to reſt on them: they giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues greedily to hunt after the things of this world. Are there not ſome who would be thought to be the children of God, that are tainted with the damnable ſinne of vſurie?

If we ſhould duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, would any man well in his wits, thinke that he could find happines in vanitie?

<pb n="483" facs="tcp:492:246"/> tranſitorie things, <hi>And be not thou vaine:</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, Pſal. 62.10. <hi>If riches increaſe ſet not thine heart on them.</hi> No, no, thou profeſſing thy ſelfe a child of God, follow thou the counſell of the holy Spirit of God, 1. Cor. 7.31. <hi>

Therefore vſe thou the things of this world, as helpes and furtherances to thee in thy trauell towards heauen, but ſet not thine heart on them, let them not ſteale away thine heart from better things, but ſet thine heart on better things, on righteouſneſſe, the peace of a good conſcience, the fauour of God in Chriſt, and the comforts in Chriſt, and on the ioyes of the life to come, and thoſe are durable things, and ſhall laſt for euer: and thou profeſſing thy ſelfe a child of God, thou art to count all things of this world but droſſe and dung, in compariſon of thoſe excellent treaſures.</p>

               <p>How can theſe Scriptures agree with this text of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and the expoſition now giuen of it, That the whole frame of this viſible world ſhall be freed from corruption, and ſhall partake with the children of God in incorruption, and in immortalitie? To this I anſwer. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> The Scriptures alledged do not any thing at all croſſe this text of the Apoſtle, nor the expoſition now giuen of it, if they be rightly vnderſtood. For whereas the Pſalmiſt ſaith, the heauens ſhall periſh, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth himſelfe, in that he ſaith they ſhall be changed: and the meaning of the other places alledged, is not that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, and the earth, and the elements ſhall be annihilated, waſted, and brought to nothing, and ceaſſe to be at all, but that they ſhall haue as it were a new being, they ſhall be made new, not in regard of ſubſtance, they ſhall not be made new

               <p>Now here I hold it needfull for further clearing of this text, to anſwer a queſtion that is commonly propounded, namely this. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> Whether the fowles, beaſts, and fiſhes, ſhall be freed from the bondage of corruption at the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be then made partakers of incorruption and of immortalitie, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> or no? To this queſtion we can anſwer nothing certainly, but onely that which is likely and probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture is ſilent in this: but that which may be gathered out of the Scripture in anſwer to this queſtion, as I conceiue moſt likely and probable, is this: That thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their kinds, namely, ſome ſingulars of all kinds, ſhall be freed from corruption, and ſhall be made partakers of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption and immortalitie: becauſe they are found Geneſ. 1. among thoſe creatures that were made in the firſt ſixe dayes. And thoſe that were then made, and by the fall of man brought vnder vanitie and corruption, it is likely they ſhall be reſtored to their originall integritie at the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in their kinds. Indeed not euery particular fowle, beaſt, or fiſh, that hath bene, now is, or hereafter ſhall be, there is no likelyhood of that, that I hold ſhall not be, for then there ſhould be a kind of reſurrection of thoſe creatures, their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being in the world but a ſhort time, they being renewed and multiplied by continuall generation. And if euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular fowle, beaſt, and fiſh, ſhould be reſtored to their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall integritie, then either the ſame particular fowles, beaſts, and fiſhes, being dead and diſſolued, as the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of men and women, ſhall riſe againe, and be reſtored at the day of iudgement, or ſome other of the ſame kind ſhould be newly created: but neither of theſe things ſhall be, becauſe for the firſt, we are not not to beleeue the reſurrection of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creature, but onely of the bodies of men and women: and
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:492:253"/> for the ſecond, the day of iudgement ſhall not be a day of creation, but a day of reſtauration, and a day <hi>of restoring of all things,</hi> as it is called Act. 3.21. If any aske, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> what vſe ſhall there be of theſe creatures after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt iudgement? <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> I may anſwer him with another queſtion: What vſe ſhall there be of the viſible heauens, and of the earth, when as the manſion of Gods elect is prepared for them in the higheſt heauens? In theſe things we are not to be curious. What if the Lord will haue the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, and the earth, and the ſame particular fowles, and beaſts, and fiſhes, to continue as monuments of his former power, wiſedome and goodneſſe towards man? we are not curiouſly to ſearch into theſe things, nor to moue other thornie and vnprofitable queſtions; as what number ſhall be reſtored, and the like: learned ignorance (as one ſaith) is better then know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, where the Scripture is ſilent. Now then thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the meaning of the Apoſtle in this verſe, as if he had ſaid:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe the whole frame of this viſible world, the viſible hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens with all their furniture, the earth with all her ornaments, and other elements, yea ſome ſingulars of all the kindes of fowles, beaſts, and fiſhes, ſhall at the day of iudgement be freed from the ſtate of corruption, which is as a heauie ſeruitude and bondage to them, and ſhall then partake with the children of God in ſome degree of their glorie, namely, in incorruption and in immortalitie, and ſhall then be changed and reſtored into that originall integritie and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in which they were firſt made and created.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now firſt we may hence gather the wonderfull benefit that cometh to Gods children by Chriſt touching the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they haue not onely in and through him right and title to the good creatures of God here in this world, and may comfortably vſe them, but they haue alſo this benefit through the obedience of Chriſt imputed to them, that after the day of iudgement the creatures ſhall be reſtored to their originall integritie and excellencie for their ſakes. Becauſe as the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> defection and fall, deſerued to be puniſhed both in his perſon and in all things appertaining to him: ſo it was meete that the ſecond <hi>Adams</hi> obedience ſhould not onely
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:492:254"/> reſtore man, but the creatures alſo which might be any way a fit appurtenance to him in the ſtate of glorie: but I paſſe from that.</p>
               <p>Obſerue we here, the Apoſtle ſaith the creature ſhall be deliuered and ſet free from the bondage of corruption, and then it ſhall partake of the glorious libertie of Gods children, it ſhall then ſhare with them in incorruption and immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <label type="milestone">

Here is then matter and ground of ſweete and of excellent comfort for all that finde themſelues in that number. Haſt thou good euidence of it that thou art a child of God, that thou art an adopted ſonne or daughter of God? then know to thy comfort, thou haſt not onely here in this world liberty of grace, and liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from an euil conſcience, which thou wouldeſt not part withall for all the riches and glorie of the world, but thou ſhalt at the day of iudgement haue thy libertie wonderfully enlarged, thou ſhalt then haue libertie of eternall glorie, euen ſuch a glorious libertie, as no wicked man or woman, though here in this world their outward pompe and glorie be neuer ſo great, ſhall be partakers of. Haply here in this world thou art vnder ſome outward ſeruitude and bondage, thou art vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pouertie, and it may be thou art inthralled in fetters and chaines, thou art in priſon, and reſtrained from outward li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, yet thou being a child of God, thou haſt the libertie of grace in thy ſoule, and the libertie of a quiet and good conſcience, which is better then all the riches and glorie in the world; and at the day of iudgement thy libertie ſhall be
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:492:257"/> vnſpeakeable and glorious; then ſhalt thou be freed from all manner of euils both in ſoule and bodie, from the euill of ſinne, and from the euill of paine and ſuffering; and thy liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then ſhall be accompanied with vnſpeakeable and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueable glorie: when as the wicked and vngodly, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this world haue had manie outward liberties and great outward glorie, ſhall enter into bondage of endleſſe woe and miſerie. And this may be matter of great comfort to thee, yea conſider this to thy comfort, thy libertie of grace here in this world is imperfect, and thy libertie and peace of a good conſcience is here mingled with ſome doubting and feare, but at the day of iudgement and in heauen-libertie of grace ſhall be perfect, and the libertie and peace of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall be free from all doubting and feare.

Oh then thy ioy, comfort, and glorie ſhall be vnconceiueable, the heart of man is not able to conceiue it, nor tongues of men and Angels able to expreſſe it.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Verſe our Apoſtle concludes and ſhuts vp his firſt argument, by which he prooues, that the glorie wherewith Gods children ſhall be inueſted in heauen, ſhall be both exceeding great, and alſo moſt ſure and certaine, taken from the expectation of the creature, that the creature waites with feruent deſire for the manifeſtation of that glorie; and therefore it ſhall be both exceeding great, and alſo moſt ſure &amp; certaine. I ſay the Apoſtle here ſhuts vp that argument, as before we ſhewed, by ſetting downe the greatneſſe of the bondage the creature is ſubiect to, that it is ſo great, as it doth preſſe the creature as it were an heauie burden lying on it, and make the creature grone vnder the weight of it, and as it were trauell in paine vnder it for deliuerance. Yea the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Euery creature, or the whole creation,</hi> as we haue it in the New tranſlation, is vnder this great bondage, and grones and trauels in paine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether one with another, and <hi>that to this houre, to this preſent:</hi> and further ſets out that as a thing commonly knowne, <hi>We know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that euerie creature groneth together alſo with vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will ſtand a while to open the ſence and meaning of the words of this verſe. <hi>We know.</hi> That is,<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> it is a thing well knowne to vs, we certainly know it ſo to be, partly by ſenſe we ſee it ſo to be, and partly by the word of God reuealing and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king knowne to vs the cauſe of it, and the end of it. <hi>That eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie creature, or the whole creation.</hi> Some thinke the Apoſtle here intends more by the word <hi>creature,</hi> then he did in the 3. verſes foregoing, becauſe he ſaith, <hi>euerie creature:</hi> yea ſome would haue the good Angels here included, which cannot be, for they grone not vnder the bondage of corruption: but
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:492:258"/> by <hi>creature,</hi> we are ſtill to vnderſtand as before, the whole frame of this viſible world, conſiſting of celeſtiall and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly bodies, the viſible heauens with all their goodly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the earth and all her ornaments. And the Apoſtle here ſaith, <hi>Euerie creature, or the whole creation:</hi> thereby ſignifying, that all and euerie creature in this viſible world, do agree in this, that all and euerie one of them do grone and trauell in paine for deliuerance from the bondage of corruption. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer euerie particular foule, beaſt, or fiſh (as before I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſhall not at the day of iudgement be reſtored, and haue that particular being as now they haue, or haue had, and that an euerlaſting being, and therein partake with the children of God, but onely ſome particulars of euerie ſort and kinde; yet euerie particular ſhall then ceaſſe to be miſerable, euen thoſe particulars which ſhall not be reſtored, ſhall yet be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued into the elements out of which they were taken, and there reſt, and ſo ceaſſe to be any more vnder the bondage of corruption: the elements being now reſtored to their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall integritie and excellencie in which they were created. And ſo though euerie creature ſhall not be deliuered into the glorious libertie of the ſonnes of God, yet euerie creature grones and trauels in paine for deliuerance. Theſe words, <hi>Groneth and trauelleth in paine,</hi> are metaphoricall and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed termes. The firſt from one that is laden with an heauie burden, vnder which it pants and grones, and longs to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of it: and the other from a woman in her paines of child-bearing and of bringing forth her child, who earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires deliuerance. And ſo the meaning is this, that as a man laden with an heauie burden, vnder which he pants and grones, and longs to be eaſed of it, and as a woman in trauell of child, and in her paines of bringing forth her child, earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires to be deliuered, ſo earneſtly and ſo vehemently doth euerie creature in this world long and deſire to be eaſed and to be deliuered from that vanitie and that bondage of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption it lyes vnder. <hi>Together, grones together.</hi> That is, as it were with one heart, and with one conſent. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto this preſent:</hi> or to this moment of time, or as yet, and ſtill, ſo the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth.
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:492:258"/> Thus then conceiue we the meaning of the words of this verſe, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For we certainly know, partly by ſenſe, and partly by the word of God reuealing it to vs, that the whole creation, euen all and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie creature in the frame of this viſible world, do as it were grone and trauell in paine, as a woman in paines of child-bearing, euen earneſtly and vehemently long and deſire to be eaſed and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from that vanitie and that bondage of corruption they now lye vnder: yea all creatures ioyntly together, as it were with one heart and with one conſent, do thus grone and trauell in paine, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring deliuerance, and that to this preſent, to this moment of time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to take things in order, obſere we, the Apoſtle here affirmes this, that euerie creature grones and trauels for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance from vnder the bondage of vanitie and corruption, as a thing certainly knowne to himſelfe and to the beleeuing Romans. <hi>We know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that euery creature groneth with vs alſo.</hi> Whence note briefly.</p>
               <p>That we are not to be ignorant of this, that the poore <label type="milestone">

               <p>How far from this are many men and women in the world, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> they cannot chuſe but ſee and diſcerne (if they be not ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or wilfully blind) that the poore creatures in the world as it were grone vnder the burden of vanitie and corruption:<note place="margin">Reproofe of ſuch as do not thus conceiue of it.</note> their owne eyes and ſenſes may teach them thus much. But alas, this they conceiue not as they are taught to conceiue of it by the holy word of God,<note place="margin">The fruit of their miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of it.</note> as that the poore creatures lye vnder this as vnder the curſe of God; this they are not acquainted
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:492:259"/> withall, and that makes them many times aſcribe the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and changes that befall the creatures, and the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the creatures to do them ſeruice and to yeeld them comfort, to chance or fortune, or to ſecondarie cauſes, Well, we muſt be able to ſay, we know that euerie creature grones and trauels in paine vnder the burden of vanitie and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not onely by ſenſe and experience, but from the holy word of God, that we are come to the vnderſtanding of this by the word of God, and that indeed we vnderſtand it as the holy word of God makes it knowne vnto vs, that the poore creatures lye vnder this burden as vnder the curſe of God. And ſo much be ſpoken briefly of that.</p>
               <p>In the next place obſerue we, the Apoſtle here puts on the creatures as it were a perſon, he brings them in groning and trauelling in paine vnder the burden of vanitie and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and longing after and deſiring eaſe and deliuerance from it. He makes the poore, dumbe, and liueleſſe creatures as it were ſenſible of their miſerie, of that vanitie and corruption they lye vnder, yea ſo ſenſible of it, as that in their kind they grone vnder the burden of it, and as earneſtly deſire to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of it and deliuered from it, as a woman in trauell of child, that is full of paine, deſires to be deliuered of her child. And what may this teach vs? ſurely thus much.</p>
               <p>That we to whom God hath giuen reaſon and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> are much more to be ſenſible of our corruption and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie,<note place="margin">The corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinne that cleaues to our ſoules &amp; bodies, ought to be felt as an heauie burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire to be eaſed of it</note> and eſpecially of that corruption of ſinne that cleaues to our ſoules and bodies, and of our fearefull miſerie in regard of that, we are much more to grone vnder the burden of ſinne preſſing our ſoules, and moſt earneſtly to deſire to be eaſed of that burden, and to be deliuered from it. Chap. 7. of this Epiſtle verſe 24. the Apoſtle cries out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me from the bodie of this death?</hi> He was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the very remainder of ſin ſtill abiding in him, and he groned vnder that burden, and deſired deliuerance from it, and that moſt earneſtly. Philip. 1.23. he ſaith, <hi>He deſired to be looſed:</hi> that his ſoule might be looſed from his bodie: indeed chiefly (as there he ſpeakes) <hi>that he might be with Chriſt:</hi> that
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:492:259"/> he might haue immediate fellowſhip with Chriſt, and enioy fulneſſe of ioy and glorie with him in heauen: yet no doubt one cauſe of his deſire was, that he might be freed from the burden of ſinne ſtill abiding in him. And thus doubtleſſe it is with all Gods children, they are ſenſible of that corruption of ſinne that ſtill cleaues to them, and of their fearefull miſerie and thraldome, and bondage in regard of that, and they grone vnder the burthen of the remainder of ſinne ſtill abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in them, and earneſtly deſire to be deliuered from it. And it ought to be thus with euery one of vs, we are to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the corruption of ſinne cleauing to our ſoules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and of our miſerie in regard of that, &amp; earneſtly to deſire to be eaſed of that burthen, and to be deliuered from it: and there is reaſon <label type="milestone">

               <p>We are to marke further, that the Apoſtle here bringeth in the creatures, groning and trauelling in paine, and that
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:492:260"/> ioyntly together, as it were with one heart, and with one conſent. He makes the dumbe and ſenſleſſe creatures, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after a ſort ſenſible of their miſerie, of that vanitie and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption they lie vnder, but as it were to condole and bemone one another, and to haue as it were a fellow feeling of one anothers miſerie, and ſo to grone together, and to trauell in paine together one with another, longing for eaſe and for deliuerance. We find that the Lord by his Prophet bringeth in the dumbe creatures, as it were hearing the complaint one of another.

We then ſeeing others groning vnder the burthen of any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, to be ſo farre from being ſenſible of their miſerie, and from groning with them, as that we inſult ouer them, and thereupon take aduantage to deale hardly with them, ſurely it is an argument of extreame hardneſſe of heart, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if we deale thus with ſuch as grone vnder the burthen of ſinne, as it is the manner of wicked and prophane perſons, when they ſee a man or a woman groning vnder the burthen of ſinne, troubled in mind and conſcience for ſinne, they make but a mocke and a ieſt of it, and they commonly ſay, ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are but melancholicke fooles, or mad men or women.
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:492:261"/> This argues extreme and monſtrous hardneſſe of heart, and <hi>this is to perſecute thoſe whom the Lord hath ſmitten, and to adde to the ſorrow of them whom he hath wounded,</hi> Pſal. 69.26. and that in an high degree.

                  <hi>I am greatly angrie againſt the careleſſe heathen, for I was angrie but a little, and they helped forward the affliction.</hi> And they that thus do, ſhall be ſure at one time or other to find the heauie hand of God on their owne ſoules.</p>

When we ſee a man or a woman groning vnder the burthen of ſinne, and troubled in mind and conſcience, we are to grone with them, to mourne with them, to pray for them, to comfort them, and to helpe them what we may: yea we are to grone for the ſins of thoſe who grone not for themſelues, being hardened in their hearts, and hauing no ſenſe nor feeling of them. Thus did good <hi>Lot,</hi> as the Apoſtle witneſſeth of him, 2. Pet. 2.7. he was <hi>vexed and grieued with the vncleane conuerſation of the filthie Sodomites:</hi> he fetched many a ſigh and ſob, and many a grone for their filthineſſe, who as the Apoſtle ſaith, Epheſ. 4.19. <hi>Being past feeling, gaue themſelues to worke all vncleanneſſe, euen with greedineſſe.</hi> And we haue the example of the Lord Ieſus, Marke 3.5. the text ſaith, <hi>He looked about on the people angerly, and mourning alſo for the hardneſſe of their hearts.</hi> They had hard hearts and groned not for themſelues, they groned not for their owne ſinnes, but the Lord Ieſus he mourned and groned in his heart for them, and thus are we to do; we are to grone with them who feele the weight of their ſinnes lying heauie on their ſoules, and do grone vnder the burthen of them.<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>Yea we are to grone for their ſinnes who haue hard hearts, and neither do nor can grone for themſelues; and our eyes are to poure out flouds of teares for them who keepe not Gods Law,</hi>
                  <pb n="514" facs="tcp:492:262"/> as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith and did, Pſal. 119.136.

               <p>One thing yet remaines to be noted in this verſe, I will but touch it in a word. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Euery creature gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth together with vs, and to this preſent,</hi> to this very moment and minute of time. Thus ſpake the Apoſtle in the time when he writ this Epiſtle, and thus may we ſtill ſay, that euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture grones with vs to this very moment, it is ſtill ſo: and ſo the point hence is this.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> The word ſignifying <hi>creature,</hi> is not in the originall, but it is of neceſſity to be ſupplyed, and may well be added to make vp the ſence anſwerable to the former verſe: <hi>Euerie creature groneth with vs alſo;</hi> and not onely the creature or the whole creation, <hi>But we alſo which haue the firſt fruits of the Spirit.</hi> Some would haue the Apoſtles onely here to be meant, when the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>we,</hi> becauſe they receiued the excellent and miraculous gifts of the Spirit: but the word <hi>we,</hi> is rather to be taken as ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying all true beleeuers, the Apoſtle neither in the foregoing nor in the verſes following ſpeaking of himſelfe as an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, but as a true beleeuer, together with the true beleeuing Romans.

And to this the Apoſtle alludes here on this manner: that as by offering the firſt fruits by the Iewes, the reſt of their crop was ſanctified, and thereby they had certaine hope of a good harueſt, and that they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the reſt of their crop in due ſeaſon: ſo the portion of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and ſpirituall grace that Gods children haue here, and the ſpeciall gifts of the Spirit peculiar to Gods elect here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on them, as calling, faith, iuſtification, ſanctification, peace of conſcience, ſpirituall ioy, hope, loue, repentance, and the like, are as it were firſt fruits to them, euen pawnes and pledges to them that they ſhall hereafter haue the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and the accompliſhment of them, and the fulneſſe of ioy, and the whole maſſe of glorie promiſed to them.

But alas, if men or women haue no better ground of comfort then this, that they are Gods creatures, they are in a poore and miſerable caſe, the oxe or the aſſe is in that reſpect as neare heauen as they, for they are alſo Gods creatures.

               <p>In the next place, the deſcription of the godly and true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers here giuen by the Apoſtle, comes to be conſidered and ſtood on: the Apoſtle thus deſcribing the godly and true beleeuers, that they are ſuch as haue <hi>the firſt fruits of the Spirit:</hi> that is, as we ſhewed, ſuch as haue the beginnings of true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing grace, and the ſpeciall gifts of the Spirit peculiar to Gods elect, as pawnes and pledges to them of the perfection of them hereafter, and of fulneſſe of ioy and glorie in heauen, which the Lord hath promiſed to them in time to be giuen <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>That the beginnings of true ſauing grace in Gods children, and the ſpeciall gifts of the Spirit, and gifts peculiar to Gods elect beſtowed on them, are as ſufficient pawnes and pledges to aſſure them, that hereafter they ſhall haue full perfection of grace, and fulneſſe of ioy and glorie in heauen.

Corinth. 1.22.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.22.</note> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaking of himſelfe and of other true beleeuers, ſaith,

                  <hi>God hath ſealed vs, and hath giuen the earneſt of the Spirit in our hearts.</hi> He compares the Spirit of God giuen to his children to an earneſt pennie, that as men do aſſure others that they will pay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole ſumme due for this or that, by giuing them an earneſt pennie; ſo the Lord doth giue his children here in this world the ſpeciall gifts of his Spirit, as it were part of payment, and as an earneſt pennie, the better to aſſure them that in due time they ſhall receiue fulneſſe both of grace and glorie. And to the ſame purpoſe ſpeakes the Apoſtle.

Theſe places do ſufficiently cleare and confirme the truth of the point in hand, that the beginnings of true ſauing grace, and the ſpeciall gifts of the Spirit of God, peculiar to Gods elect, beſtowed on Gods children, are as ſufficient pawnes and pledges to aſſure them that hereafter they ſhall haue perfection of grace, and fulneſſe of ioy and glorie in heauen.</p>
               <p>And the reaſons and grounds of this truth are theſe.</p>

And therefore on theſe grounds we may reſolue on this as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine truth, that the beginnings of true ſauing grace, and the ſpeciall gifts of the Spirit of God, the gifts peculiar to Gods elect beſtowed on Gods children, are as ſufficient pawnes and pledges to aſſure them that hereafter they ſhall haue both perfection of grace, and alſo fulneſſe of ioy and glorie in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>

<pb n="524" facs="tcp:492:267"/> Gods children cannot ſufficiently magnifie Gods goodneſſe and mercie towards them.</p>

Though we will not ſometimes truſt a man on his word, or on his bill, or bond, yet on a ſufficient pawne we dare truſt any man, and ſhall we not then truſt the Lord on ſo good and ſufficient a pawne lying with vs, as the beginnings of true ſauing grace, and the ſpeciall gifts of the Spirit of God, the gifts peculiar to Gods elect?

I know it is a point of controuerſie betweene vs and the Papiſts, and they ſay, that none can in this life be aſſured that they ſhall hereafter enioy life and glorie in heauen. I will not enter the controuerſie, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider we thus much; can a man or a woman haue the firſt fruits of the Spirit, and then be diſappointed of the ioy and glorie in heauen? Hath the Lord begun a good worke in his children, and will not he perfect it? Why ſurely the ſauing grace that Gods children here haue, is a beginning of that glorious being they ſhall receiue in heauen, it is the ſame for ſubſtance, differing onely in degree. And therefore doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſuch as haue the beginnings of true ſauing grace, and the ſpeciall gifts of the Spirit of God, the gifts peculiar to Gods elect, may thereupon certainly perſwade themſelues, that they ſhall in time come to haue perfection of grace, and

               <p>Firſt, by the roote of it, if the grace that is in thee come from Chriſt as the roote: for Chriſt is not onely the author of ſpirituall life, as the Father and the holy Ghoſt, but he is alſo the cauſe of it, and he hath it in himſelfe, that he may conuey it to all that truly beleeue in him: he is <hi>an appointed head to the Church,</hi> Epheſ. 1.22. <hi>He is the Lord of life,</hi> Act. 3.15. <hi>He is a quickening Spirit,</hi> 1. Cor. 15.45. And if the grace that is in thee come from Chriſt as the roote of it, and Chriſt liues in thee as the roote of a tree liues in the branches of it, and thou art able to ſay with the Apoſtle, Galat. 2.20.<note place="margin">Galat. 2.20.</note>

               <p>Secondly, by the extent of it, if the grace that is in thee do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <pb n="526" facs="tcp:492:268"/> extend and reach it ſelfe to all the powers of thy ſoule, and to all the parts of thy bodie, thou art wrought on throughout, and there is a proportionable meaſure of grace in all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of thy ſoule, and in all the parts and members of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and the grace that is in thee, doth reach alſo to all the parts of thy life, for true grace ſpreadeth it ſelfe ouer the whole man.

And thou doſt thus hate ſinne, both in thy ſelfe and in all others, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, Pſal. 119.6. <hi>Thou haſt respect to all the commandements of God,</hi> and thou haſt now a ſingle care to pleaſe and to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in all things, and a willingneſſe in thee to obey the will of God in euery particular thing made knowne to thee out of his word that concernes thee within the compaſſe of thy place and calling, and that freely, as if there were no law to compell thee, no heauen to reward thee, nor hell to puniſh euill doers; yea to obey the will of God in euery thing, though it be againſt thy profit, thy pleaſure, thy credit, thy libertie, thine eaſe, or the liking of carnall friends, and ſuch like.

If it be thus with thee, if the grace that is in thee thus come from a right roote, namely, from Chriſt Ieſus, and be thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and doth thus reach it ſelfe ouer all the powers and faculties of thy ſoule, and ouer all the parts and members of thy bodie, and to all the parts of thy life, and haue this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall working in thee, working in thee vprightneſſe of heart, louing all good things becauſe they are good, and hating all ſinnes becauſe they are ſinnes and diſpleaſing to God, then is the grace that is in thee true ſauing grace, and the gifts of the Spirit of God beſtowed on thee are ſpeciall gifts, proper to Gods children, and thou art now gone beyond an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, and thou maiſt thereupon conclude, to the comfort of thine owne ſoule, thou art in the ſtate of grace, and that thou ſhalt in time haue perfection of grace, and fulneſſe of ioy, and glorie giuen thee in heauen: and hereby let euery one trie himſelfe.</p>

               <p>Now the ſecond is this, that in this life Gods children haue not fulneſſe and perfection of ſauing grace beſtowed on them, but onely ſome part and portion of it, euen ſo much as the Lord in his wiſedome ſeeth meete and fit for them.<note place="margin">Gods children haue not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of grace in them in this life, but only ſo much as the Lord in his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſeeth meete and fit for them.</note> They haue here onely the firſt fruites of ſauing grace, not a full har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt of it. And as the firſt fruites among the Iewes were but an handfull in compariſon of their whole crop and full harueſt:
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:492:269"/> ſo the ſauing graces and gifts of God proper to Gods cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, here in this life beſtowed on Gods children, are but as an handfull, euen a ſmall meaſure in compariſon of that fulneſſe and perfection of them that ſhall be giuen to them in heauen. And to this purpoſe alſo ſits that compariſon of an earneſt, the ſpeciall gifts and graces of the Spirit of God being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to an earneſt in the places before cited. And as an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt is but a little in compariſon of the whole ſumme, haply a ſhilling, or ten ſhillings, giuen in earneſt for the payment of an hundred pounds or more: ſo are the ſpeciall gifts and graces of God, here giuen to Gods children, but a ſmall thing in compariſon of that fulneſſe of grace they ſhall hereafter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in the kingdome of heauen. 1. Cor. 13.9.<note place="margin">1.

And ſo true beleeuers, Gods children, haue not here in this life fulneſſe and perfection of ſauing grace beſtowed on them, but onely ſome part and portion of it: euen ſo much as the Lord in his wiſedome ſees meete and fit for them. And indeed to giue you ſome reaſons of this truth.</p>

It is not ſo with hypocrites, with carnall perſons, when they ſigh, though it be for ſinne, yet it is not heartily and ſoundly. And this difference may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare thus: when Gods children ſigh for ſome actuall ſinne
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:492:273"/> whereof they are guiltie, they reſt not in ſighing for that, but they go downe to the roote of that and all their other ſinnes, the corruption of their nature, and they fetch their ſighs from vnder that corruption that cleaues to their hearts, in which they were conceiued and borne, and which is the roote and mother of all their ſinnes, and they grone vnder the burthen of that. Thus did <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pfal. 51. he reſted not in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of his adulterie and murder, and in ſighing and groning for thoſe actuall ſinnes, but he went downe to the roote of thoſe and of all his other ſinnes, the ſinne of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and birth, verſe 5. <hi>Behold I was borne in iniquitie, and in ſinne hath my mother conceiued me.</hi> But hypocrites and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall perſons, they reſt in this, that they ſigh and grone for ſome actuall ſinne; their conſciences being awakened, and now they ſeeing and feeling ſome actuall ſinne preſſing and lying heauie vpon their conſciences, haply thereupon they ſend out a naturall ſigh or ſob, in regard of ſome outward thing, in regard of ſhame and puniſhment due to them for that ſinne, or in regard of the hand of God on them by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, paine, or the like; as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did when the hand of God was on him, then he cried, <hi>I haue ſinned, and take away this plague:</hi> but he neuer cried, take away the hardneſſe of heart, and curſedneſſe of my nature. And thus it is with hypocrites and carnall perſons, they grone onely as the bruite beaſt doth that is preſſed with ſome heauie burthen, but they neuer go downe to the roote of ſinne and grone vnder that as an heauie burthen, and fetch their ſighes from vnder that; and ſo they grone not with their hearts ſoundly when they ſigh for their ſinnes. And of this the Lord complaines, Hoze. 7.14. <hi>They haue not cryed vnto me with their hearts</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when they how led vpon their beds.</hi> If then thou wouldſt haue true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in thy ſighing and groning for ſinne, looke thou go downe to the roote of all ſinnes in thy ſelfe, and ſigh in thy ſelfe, euen from vnder that corruption that cleaues to thy ſoule inwardly, and then doubtleſſe thy ſighing is a ſound ſighing, and a ſighing of a child of God, and it is then plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, and will yeeld comfort to thine owne ſoule.</p>

               <p>Now in this 24. verſe, in the firſt words of it the Apoſtle preuents an obiection. For ſome might ſay to him, You tel vs that ſuch as haue the firſt fruits of the Spirit waite for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, euen the redemption of our bodie: why, are not we being true beleeuers, and hauing the firſt fruits of the Spirit, the adopted ſonnes and daughters of God? are not we alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die redeemed? This the Apoſtle preuents, by making knowne that though we being true beleeuers, and hauing the firſt fruits of the Spirit, and be the adopted ſonnes and daughters of God, and be redeemed, yet we haue not the conſummation of our adoption, and the accompliſhment of our redemption, but we ſtill waite for it. For why, our ſaluation is by hope: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we are ſaued by hope:</hi> and therefore our redemption is not yet complete, it is not yet fully perfected. Now the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of this conſequence, we are ſaued by hope, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue not the conſummation of our adoption, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of our redemption, is further confirmed from the obiect of hope, that hope hath for the obiect of it things that are not ſeene, and things that are not preſent; which the Apoſtle propounds by denying the obiect of hope to be things ſeene. <hi>But hope</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that is ſeene is not hope:</hi> or the thing hoped for is not a thing ſeene. Prouing that from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:492:280"/> ſenſe, that it were verie abſurd and ridiculous for a man to hope for that which he ſees and hath in preſent poſſeſſion, in the laſt words of 24. verſe: <hi>For how can a man hope for that which he ſeeth?</hi> Then verſe 25. the Apoſtle makes knowne the true obiect of hope to be things not ſeene; and withall concludes his argument with this hypotheticall propoſition, that <hi>if we hope for that we ſee not,</hi> for that which is not preſent, but abſent from vs, <hi>we do with patience abide and waite for it:</hi> therein infolding an exhortation; and he driues to this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall purpoſe, namely, to perſwade the beleeuing Romans and other true beleeuers, patiently to beare the croſſe, and other afflictions that here in this world they meete withall, and to waite for a full deliuerance from them, and for their full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption hereafter. And thus we ſee the drift and purpoſe of the Apoſtle in theſe two verſes, and the ſumme and ſubſtance of them.</p>
               <p>And here we haue theſe things in generall layed before vs, firſt a propoſition, <hi>We are ſaued by hope.</hi> Secondly hope, deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the obiect of it, that the thing hoped for is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but a thing abſent and not ſeene.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, that hope hath a patient waiting adioyned to it.<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> I will now lay forth the ſence and meaning of theſe two verſes. <hi>For we are ſaued by hope.</hi> By the perſons here vnder the word <hi>we,</hi> the Apoſtle meanes himſelfe and the true beleeuing Romans, and all other true beleeuers. <hi>Are ſaued.</hi> Saluation is ſometimes in the Scripture taken for the beginning of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, conſiſting in new birth, and in the remiſſion of ſinnes, and reconciliation with God in Chriſt, as Tit. 3.5. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Not by the workes of righteouſneſſe which we had done, but according to his mercie he ſaued vs, by the waſhing of the new birth, and the renewing of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> But here it ſignifieth the fulneſſe and perfection in heauen, namely, the glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and happie eſtate both of the ſoule and bodie in the kingdome of heauen: and ſo the meaning is, we haue full and perfect ſaluation, euen the glorification and happineſſe both of our ſoules and bodies in heauen. <hi>By hope,</hi> or <hi>in hope:</hi> that is, not in preſent poſſeſſion, but ſo as we do expect and looke for
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:492:280"/> it hereafter; for the word <hi>hope</hi> here ſignifies the grace of hope in the heart and ſoule, whereby euerie true beleeuer doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly expect and looke to enioy ſaluation promiſed. <hi>But hope that is ſeene.</hi> The word <hi>hope</hi> is here in the firſt place by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymie put for the thing hoped for, and ſo the word <hi>hope</hi> is vſed, Coloſſ. 1.5. <hi>For the hopes ſake which is layed vp for you in heauen:</hi> that is, for the eternall happineſſe, life, and glories ſake layed vp for you in heauen. But in the ſecond place, the word <hi>hope</hi> is put for the grace of hope in the heart: and ſo the meaning is, when the thing hoped for is ſeene, that is, preſent, and is poſſeſſed, it is not the obiect of hope, and it ceaſſeth to be hoped for. <hi>For how can a man hope for that which he ſeeth?</hi> as as if he had ſaid, for hope is an expectation of good things to come; and things preſent, or things poſſeſſed, cannot be the obiect of hope. <hi>But if we hope:</hi> that is, if we expect &amp; looke for that good thing which is not preſent, and before our eyes, and poſſeſſed: <hi>we do with patience abide for it:</hi> that is, we do waite till the time come that we be poſſeſſed of it, and do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy it, patiently and conſtantly bearing the euils, croſſes, and afflictions we meete withall in the meane time. Now then thus conceiue we the meaning of the words of theſe two ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For I and you, and all true beleeuers, haue full and perfect ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, euen the glorification and full happineſſe both of our ſoules and bodies in heauen, not in preſent poſſeſſion, but ſo as we do expect and looke for it hereafter, or we haue and hold it now in hope. Now when the thing hoped for is preſent, and is poſſeſſed, it ceaſſeth to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for: for hope is an expectation of good things to come, and a man cannot hope for things preſent, or for things that are by him alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die poſſeſſed; but if we do expect and looke for the good thing which is not preſent, or poſſeſſed, we do waite till the time come that we be poſſeſſed of it, and do enioy it, patiently and conſtantly bearing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, croſſes, and afflictions that we meete withall in the meane time: and ſo indeed we expecting and looking for full and perfect ſaluation, euen perfect happineſſe both of our bodies and ſoules in heauen, we do with a patient bearing of all things that befall vs in the meane time, waite till the time come that we be poſſeſſed of it, &amp; do enioy it.</hi>

               <pb n="552" facs="tcp:492:281"/>
               <p>Come we now to ſtand on theſe two verſes more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly as they lye in order; and firſt to free the Apoſtles propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the firſt words of the 24. verſe, <hi>We are ſaued by hope,</hi> from that which the Papiſts do falſely faſten on it, and would thence gather. In that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are ſaued by hope,</hi> the Papiſts do note and conclude, that therefore we are not ſaued by faith onely, but that hope is alſo the cauſe of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. This cauill may eaſily be remoued, if we remember how this propoſition hath bene expounded, namely, that true beleeuers here in this world haue full and perfect ſaluation in heauen, not in preſent poſſeſſion, but ſo as they do expect and looke for it hereafter; they haue it by hope, or rather in hope, and their ſaluation is a thing not preſently ſeene and poſſeſſed, but it lyeth in hope, or it is a thing hoped for: will it thereupon follow, that therefore hope is the cauſe of their ſaluation? Is hope and expectation of a good thing promiſed, the cauſe of enioying of it when it is had? A man hath a piece of land or mony promiſed him, and he hopes &amp; looks to haue it and to enioy it in time, is his hope and expectation of it the cauſe of his enioying it? nothing leſſe. So true beleeuers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting and looking for promiſed ſaluation, is their hope and expectation the cauſe of their ſaluation? no ſuch matter. And therefore it is a falſe concluſion the Papiſts hence gather, that we are ſaued by hope, &amp; therefore hope is the cauſe of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I leaue this, and to point at one thing briefly that may be of vſe: This propoſition, <hi>we are ſaued by hope,</hi> or in hope, being vnderſtood as we haue expounded it, it giues vs to vnderſtand thus much, it plainly teacheth vs.</p>

                  <hi>Despaire being a maine and foule herifie, it denies God to be a Father, Ieſus Chriſt to be a Sauiour, and the holy Ghost to be a comforter, yea it denies the loue, the truth, and the power of God.</hi> It concernes therefore euerie one of vs, we hauing ſound and good hope of happineſſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in heauen, to labour to maintaine and to preſerue our hope, and to fortifie and ſtrengthen that hope of ours by all good meanes, and euer to be vnderpropping of our hope, and that by a due and ſerious conſideration of Gods free loue to vs in Ieſus Chriſt, of the certaine and infallible truth of his word and promiſes, of his infinite power, and of his vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wiſedome.

Theſe things are to be thought on, and being duely conſidered, they will be a notable meanes to ſtrengthen and to vphold our hope of heauen, and to make vs to continue ſtedfaſt in our hope in the greateſt batterie and aſſault that Satan can lay againſt vs to driue vs from our hope. And to theſe we muſt adde earneſt prayer to God, and a carefull vſe of his holy ordinances, and often to vſe the Sacraments, praying with <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 119.116.117. <hi>Stabliſh me Lord in the time of aſſault, and diſſappoint me not of mine hope.

               <p>I proceed, and come to the deſcription of the hope here layed before vs. The Apoſtle here deſcribes hope by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of it: firſt, by denying the obiect of hope to be things preſent, or things ſeene: <hi>Hope that is ſeene</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not hope, for how can a man hope for that which he ſeeth?</hi> And then by the proper obiect of it, and that proper obiect of hope, is that which is not preſent, or that which is not ſeene, verſe 25. <hi>If we hope for that we ſee not, we do with patience abide for it.</hi> Now hence in the firſt place we may eaſily conclude and gather what true Chriſtian hope is, in reſpect of the obiect of it: and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> we may hence take vp this concluſion.</p>
               <p>That true Chriſtian hope, and true ſauing hope, the hope of Gods children, is an expectation of good things to come,<note place="margin">True Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſauing hope is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of good things to come.</note> and neither good things paſt, nor good things preſent, but onely good things abſent, and as yet to come, are the things that true Chriſtian hope, the hope of true beleeuers doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:492:283"/> and looke after: and to this purpoſe we find, that eternall life, happineſſe, and ſaluation, which are things abſent, and layd vp in the higheſt heauens, are vſually put downe in the Scripture, as the moſt proper obiect of ſauing hope. And hence is true ſauing hope called the <hi>hope of ſaluation.</hi> 1. Theſ. 5.8. <hi>Putting on the hope of ſaluation for an helmet,</hi> and the <hi>hope of glorie,</hi> Rom. 5.2. and the <hi>hope of eternall life,</hi> Tit. 3.7. And to this agrees that compariſon the holy Ghoſt vſeth, Heb. 6.19. comparing true ſauing hope to an <hi>anker,</hi> and calling it <hi>the anker of the ſoule both ſure and ſtedfast:</hi> and it is fitly ſo compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for as the anker of a ſhip is let downe into the waters, and goeth downe to the bottome, and is faſtened to the earth that is not ſeene but lies hid vnder the waters, ſo true ſauing hope is fixed to good things that are not ſeene: and as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt here ſaith, <hi>It enters into that which is within the vaile,</hi> euen within the vaile of heauen. I might make it further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by inſtance in diuers particulars, that true ſauing hope doth expect and looke after good things abſent, good things that are yet to come. And indeed hope hath the very being of it from good things hoped for, not ſimply as they be good things, but as they be good things abſent, and as yet to come. Good things that are promiſed in the word of God, and are beleeued by faith, being abſent and as yet to come, they giue matter and being to Chriſtian hope. And therefore doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the true ſauing hope of Gods children is an expectation of good things to come, and neither good things paſt nor good things preſent, but onely good things abſent, and as yet to come, are things that true Chriſtian hope, the hope of true beleeuers, doth expect and looke after.

<pb n="558" facs="tcp:492:284"/> the holy Spirit of God: and therefore though the hope of Gods children be of things abſent, and as yet to come, yet it is not of things doubtfull and vncertaine.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> And for a ſecond vſe: Is it ſo that true ſauing hope, the hope of Gods children,<note place="margin">Whence it is that the men of the world thinke ſo baſely of Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and of their their hopes.</note> is an expectation of good things to come? This then further diſcouers whence it is, that prophane perſons, men of the world, thinke ſo baſely of Gods children and of their hopes, they are euer deriding them and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and inſulting ouer their meane and miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they thinke of it, and ſometimes they breake out and ſticke not to ſay, Gods children are fooles, in that they let ſlip the preſent profits, pleaſures, and honors of the world, and feede themſelues with a vaine hope (as they conceiue of it.) But alas poore ſoules, they are deceiued; and here is one cauſe of it that they are ſo deceiued, the hope of Gods children is of good things abſent, and as yet to come, and the men of the world they cannot diſcerne the happineſſe of true beleeuers in regard of their hope of good things to come. <hi>The Manna that Gods children feed on is hidden,</hi> as we haue it, Reuel. 2.17. Men of the world are ſtrangers to it, and not acquainted with it, and therefore they thinke baſely of the hopes of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſay, they are men of no hopes, and men of no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes (as they vſe to ſpeake:) but they are deceiued, and a child of God would not giue his hope of good things to
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:492:284"/> come, and that he hopes for, for the preſent poſſeſſion of the greateſt kingdome in the world: as namely, his hope of caſe, comfort, and refreſhing, and ſupport, and aſſiſtance, in the time of any trouble and affliction that ſhall be layd on him, of deliuerance out of it in the Lords good time, and of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happineſſe and glorie in heauen hereafter. For theſe are the good things to come that a child of God hopes for: and the aſſured hope of theſe things, eſpecially of happineſſe and glorie in heauen, in the heart of a child of God, is ſo ſweete and comfortable to him, as he would not part with it for the preſent poſſeſſion of all the kingdomes in the world. And if the hope of heauen, on good grounds in the heart of a child of God, be ſo ſweet and comfortable, what will be the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and comfort of the fruition and full poſſeſſion of it? without queſtion vnſpeakable and vnconceiueable. Let then the world and the men of the world ſcoffe and ſcorne Gods children, and ſay, they are men of no hopes, let not Gods children regard it: they are deceiued, the hopes of Gods children are <hi>bleſſed hopes,</hi> Tit. 2.13. and the world, and the men of the world, are not acquainted with them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deſpiſe them: and let not their ſcoffes and ſcornes trouble or diſquiet any child of God.</p>
               <p>In the next place, whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Hope that is ſeene,</hi> that is, as we haue ſhewed, the thing hoped for being ſeene and preſent, it ceaſſeth to be the obiect of hope, and it is no longer a thing hoped for; we may eaſily gather.</p>

               <p>That true ſauing hope, the hope of Gods children, being an <label type="milestone">

Reade 1.

And I muſt tell you, that euen the deareſt of Gods children are ſometimes herein ouertaken, and they do herein ſometimes diſcouer their weakneſſe: yea the deare Saints of God are ſometimes through their owne weakneſſe brought to thinke that God forgets them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members not his promiſes made to them; as when the time is long before the promiſe of good they hope for be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, or when the Lord brings them into ſtraights, or they lye vnder ſome grieuous affliction, and the Lord ſeemeth to hide his face from them: Oh then they are impatient of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and they thinke the Lord hath forgotten them, and the Lord regards them not, and they ſometimes breake out and ſay with <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 13.1. <hi>How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for euer?

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vr Apoſtle from the middle of verſe 17. hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, hath brought ſeuerall arguments to arme and ſtrengthen the beleeuing Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans againſt the bitterneſſe of the croſſe, and to perſwade them patiently to beare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions they ſhould meete withall, as namely, that they ſuffering with Chriſt, they ſhould be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with him: and that the afflictions of this life are not comparable to the glorie that ſhall be ſhewed vnto vs in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: ſetting forth the greatneſſe and certaintie of that glorie from the expectation of the creature, and from the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch as haue the firſt fruites of the Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto adding an argument from their ſauing hope, which ought to be accompanied with patience vnder the croſſe and
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:492:288"/> with a patient waiting for the accompliſhment of all Gods promiſes. Now in the 26. verſe the Apoſtle brings a new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument tending to the ſame purpoſe, and that is from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent helpe of the Spirit: that they ought not to ſhrinke or faint vnder the croſſe, becauſe the Spirit is readie to helpe and to ſupport them; which he propounds with reſpect to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going matter, as that they had not onely ſauing hope to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine them in the time of affliction, <hi>but the Spirit alſo. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Spirit alſo</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what to pray as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelfe maketh requeſt for vs with ſighes which cannot be expreſſed. But he that ſearcheth the hearts knoweth what is the meaning of the Spirit, for he maketh requeſt for the Saints according to the will of God.</hi> In theſe two verſes 26. and 27. we haue in generall offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, firſt this propoſition as a ground of comfort in the time of affliction, that the Spirit helpeth our infirmities. Secondly, a declaration how the Spirit helpeth our infirmities, that is, by the grace of prayer, by teaching and enabling vs to pray, which is not barely propounded, but amplified: firſt, by our ignorance and inabilitie to pray, <hi>For we know not what to pray as we ought,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Secondly, from whence it is that we are able to pray, and that is from the Spirit, <hi>But the Spirit it ſelfe maketh requeſt for vs:</hi> which is further enlarged by the meanes how, namely, <hi>With ſighes which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</hi> And then the third generall thing is the fruite and ſucceſſe of thoſe prayers and ſighes ſent forth by the helpe of the Spirit, layed downe verſe 27. that thoſe prayers and ſighes are knowne and accepted of the Lord. The Apoſtle deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Lord by his ſpeciall propertie, that he is a ſearcher of the heart: <hi>But he that ſearcheth the heart</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>knoweth what is the meaning of the Spirit.</hi> Then he further proues, that thoſe prayers and ſighes are knowne and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Lord, becauſe they are the prayers of the Saints, who are deare to the Lord, and they are framed according to the will of God, in the laſt words of verſe 27. <hi>For he maketh requeſt for the Saints according to the will of God.</hi> So we ſee the generall things layed before vs in theſe two verſes.</p>

                  <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo.</hi> As if he had ſaid, we being true beleeuers, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, we haue not onely ſauing hope to ſuſtaine vs in time of our afflictions, but in like manner, <hi>the Spirit alſo.</hi> By <hi>Spirit,</hi> we are not here to vnderſtand either ſpirituall grace, or loue, or the good Angell, as ſome do, but the holy Spirit of God, the third perſon in the Trinitie, as the word is taken in many verſes of this Chapter. <hi>Helpeth,</hi> or <hi>helpeth together.</hi> For ſo the word ſignifieth: it is metaphoricall or borrowed from one who is to take vp ſome heauie burthen, or to lift vp ſome great weight which he is not able to take vp, or to lift alone without helpe of another, and another then ioynes hands with him, or ſtands ouer againſt him at one end of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and helpes him to lift or take vp the burthen or weight: and ſo the meaning is, that the holy Spirit of God doth as it were ioyne hands with vs in bearing the croſſe, too heauie for vs to beare alone, and doth as it were ſtand at one end of the croſſe and helpe vs in bearing of it. <hi>Our infirmities:</hi> or weakeneſſes, or vs being infirme and weake, and not able to beare the burthen of the croſſe alone and of our ſelues: for (as I take it) the word <hi>infirmities</hi> is not here to be vnderſtood generally of all infirmities that are in Gods children, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with relation to the croſſe, and of their infirmities and weakeneſſes in vndergoing and bearing afflictions that are layed on them. <hi>For we know not what to pray as we ought:</hi> that is, euen we that are true beleeuers, and the children of God, being in afflictions, are ignorant and know not what is fit for vs to aske in prayer at the hands of God, or in what manner to pray for it, as <hi>Hezechiah</hi> ſaid, Iſai. 38.14. in the time of his ſickneſſe, he <hi>chattered like a crane or a ſwallow, and mourned as a doue. But the Spirit it ſelfe:</hi> that is, the holy Ghoſt himſelfe <hi>maketh requeſt for vs.</hi> This is not to be vnderſtood in that ſence that Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>make requeſt for vs,</hi> verſe 34. For Chriſt maketh requeſt or interceſſion for the Saints by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his merit; but the Spirit is ſaid to make requeſt for vs by cauſing and ſtirring vs vp to make requeſt for our ſelues, as the holy Spirit is ſaid to <hi>crie Abba, Father, with ſighes which
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:492:289"/> cannot be expreſſed:</hi> that is, with ſuch ſighes and grones in our hearts as we are not able to vtter by ſpeech, ſuch as we know not how to expreſſe in words. Now then not to meddle with opening the verſe following till we come to the handling of it, thus conceiue we the meaning of the Apoſtle in this 26. verſe, as if he had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And we who are true beleeuers and the children of God, haue not onely ſauing hope to ſuſtaine vs in the time of our afflictions; but in like manner the holy Spirit of God, euen the third perſon in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, he doth as it were ioyne hands with vs in bearing the croſſe: and we being infirme and weake, and not able to beare the burthen of the croſſe alone and of our ſelues, the holy Spirit of God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as it were to ſtand at one end of the croſſe, and to helpe vs in the bearing of it, for we are then ignorant and know not what is fit for vs to aske in prayer at the hands of God, and in what manner to pray for it, but the holy Spirit of God himſelfe doth then cauſe vs to pray, and ſtirs vs vp to make requeſt for our ſelues, euen with ſuch ſighes and grones in our hearts as we are not able to vtter by ſpeech, and ſuch as we kniw not how to expreſſe by words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now firſt from this propoſition, <hi>The Spirit helpeth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities:</hi> that is, we being infirme and weake, and not able to beare the burthen of the croſſe alone and of our ſelues, though we be true beleeuers and Gods children, the holy Spirit of God is pleaſed as it were to lend vs his helping hand, and as it were to ſtand at one end of the croſſe, and to helpe vs in the bearing of it: we may gather and conclude thus much.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> That Gods children, euen the beſt of them, and ſuch as haue the greateſt meaſure of grace in them,<note place="margin">The beſt of Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are not able to ſtand by their owne ſtrength with out ſhrinking &amp; fainting in time of their triall and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</note> are too weake and vnable of themſelues to beare the croſſe and afflictions they meete withall: euen the deareſt and chiefeſt of Gods children, ſuch as haue the greateſt meaſure of faith and grace, are not able to ſtand by their owne ſtrength, and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to hold out without ſhrinking and fainting in the time of triall, and in the time of trouble and affliction that is layed on them. And for the further confirming of this, we find that the beſt of Gods children being vnder the hand of God in
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:492:289"/> ſome affliction, the Lord withdrawing his hand from them but a little, and they being left in ſome ſort to themſelues, they haue diſcouered their owne corruption and weakeneſſe, and they haue ſometimes broken out into verie bitter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, as Pſal. 77.7.8.9. ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Will the Lord ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelfe for euer? and will he ſhew no more fauour? Is his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie cleane gone for euer? Doth his promiſe faile for euermore?

To theſe we might adde the example of <hi>Eliah,</hi> 1. King. 19.4. he deſired death in the time of his affliction, <hi>Take my ſoule, for I am no better then my fathers.</hi> And of <hi>Ionah,</hi> he was exceeding impatient when he ſaw that the Lord ſpared the Nineuites, Chapter 4.3. he ſaid, <hi>It was better for him to die then to liue:</hi> and verſe 9. he vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a verie dangerous ſpeech to the Lord, ſaying to him, <hi>Doſt thou well to be angrie for the gourd? Yea</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I do well to be angrie vnto the death.</hi> Thus haue the deare Saints of God being vnder the hand of God in affliction, diſcouered their corruption and weakeneſſe. And we may ſee it in daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, how pettiſh, how wayward and froward, and how impatient ſometimes are the deare Saints and ſeruants of God in the time of their affliction: and that confirmes the truth of the point in hand, that the beſt of Gods children, and ſuch as haue the greateſt meaſure of grace in them, are too weake, and vnable of themſelues to beare the croſſes and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions they meete withall.

                  </label> it is <hi>grieuous to the fleſh,</hi> Hebr. 12.11. And though the croſſe be ſanctified to

And therefore no maruell though the beſt of Gods children, and ſuch as haue the greateſt meaſure of grace, be too weake and vnable of themſelues to beare the croſſe and afflictions they meete withall, and that they are not able to ſtand by their owne ſtrength, and of themſelues to hold out without ſhrinking and fainting in the time of triall, and in the time of trouble and affliction that is layed on them.</p>

               <p>Againe, for further vſe: Is it ſo that the holy Spirit of God <label type="milestone">

Then learne we, if ſo be we find eaſe, comfort, and refreſhing in the time of affliction, and ſtrength to beare it with patience and with comfort, to giue the praiſe of that eaſe, comfort, and ſtrength where it ought to be giuen; euen to the helpe and powerfull aſſiſtance of the holy Spirit of God alone, and bleſſe him for it.

No, no, giue the praiſe of that eaſe, comfort, and ſtrength, and deliuerance, to whom it belongs, euen to the holy Spirit of God, and let him haue all the glorie for it. And when thou ſeeſt any child of God maruellous patient, and exceeding comfortable vnder ſome great and grieuous affliction, acknowledge therein the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall worke and power of the holy Spirit of God: for indeed it is not vouchſafed to all the Saints and ſeruants of God to be ſo patient and ſo chearefull vnder afflictions, the Lord ſometimes for good cauſes, beſt knowne to his holy Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, withdrawes his helping hand a little from his deareſt children in the time of their afflictions, and therefore when we ſee any child of God exceeding patient and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnder affliction, we are herein to acknowledge the good hand of God, and the ſpeciall worke of his holy Spirit, and to giue him the glorie for the ſame.</p>

<pb n="578" facs="tcp:492:294"/> that we know not how to pray as we ought.</p>

Surely then there is matter of great comfort for thee whoſoeuer thou art, that findeſt thy ſelfe ſtirred vp, &amp; made able by the holy Spirit of God, to pray, and to ſend vp to God the prayer of faith in the time of thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and in the time of thy affliction; thou mayſt thereby aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thy ſelfe, that the holy Spirit of God is reaching out his helping hand to thee, and as it were, putting vnder his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ioyning hands with thee in bearing the burthen of that croſſe, and of that affliction whatſoeuer it be, that lyeth on thee, and that thou ſhalt not ſhrinke vnder that burthen. If then thou find that it is not with thee after the manner of the wicked, who being vnder the hand of God in ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, either ſeeke to helpe themſelues by ſhifts, and by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull meanes, or are ſtirred vp by that ſpirit that is in them, to ſeeke helpe and eaſe by carnall meanes, by play, by merrie companie, by going to tauernes, and ſuch like, as <hi>Saul</hi> did by muſicke when the Spirit of the Lord was departed from him, and an euill ſpirit poſſeſſed him, 1.

See the truth of this in one or two examples. Iob 6.8.9. we finde that holy <hi>Iob</hi> being vnder the hand of God in great affliction, he was ſo farre to ſeeke touching prayer, and what was good for him to aske in prayer at the hands of God, as he brake out into a ſtrange petition, <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I might haue my deſire, and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</hi> that is, <hi>That God would deſtroy me, that he would let his hand go and cut me off!</hi> The good king <hi>Hezechiah</hi> ſaith it was ſo with him in the time of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that <hi>he chattered like a crane or a ſwallow,</hi> Iſai. 38.14. he
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:492:296"/> vttered broken petitions, and he was to ſeeke how to pray to God as he ought. And thus it hath bene with many other Saints of God, and is many times with the deareſt of Gods children, in their afflictions being great and grieuous: and why.</p>

               <p>Come we now to the ſecond amplification of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles declaration: how the Spirit helpeth our infirmities, in theſe words, <hi>But the Spirit it ſelfe maketh requeſt for vs with ſighes which cannot be expreſſed.</hi> Where the Apoſtle makes knowne, that the Spirit helpeth our infirmities in making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt for vs, with the manner how, namely, with ſighes which cannot be expreſſed. The words we haue formerly opened, and ſhewed the meaning of them to be this, That the holy Spirit of God himſelfe doth cauſe vs and make vs able to make requeſt to God for our ſelues, with ſuch ſighes and grones in our hearts as we are not able to vtter by ſpeech, and to make knowne by words.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>6</label> this.</p>
               <p>That when Gods children are plonged into ſuch deepe diſtreſſe, and vnder the hand of God in ſuch great affliction, as of themſelues they are to ſeeke how to go to God in prayer, and they cannot open their mouthes to vtter words of prayer to God, yet euen then doth the holy Spirit of God make them able in ſome ſort to ſeeke to the Lord, and then doth the holy Spirit of God enable them at leaſt to ſigh and to grone to God.<note place="margin">When Gods children are in ſuch deepe diſtreſſe as of themſelues they are to ſeeke how to go to God in prayer, then doth the holy Spirit of God enable them at the leaſt to ſigh &amp; grone to God.</note> We find that thus it was with the people of God being in the bondage of Egypt, the text ſaith, Exod. 2.23. <hi>they ſighed for the bondage, and cryed,</hi> and their ſighing and crying was to the Lord; for ſo it followes, <hi>Their crie for the bondage came vnto God, and God heard their moane, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:492:297"/> his couenant with Abraham, Izhak, &amp; Iaacob.</hi> Yea the Lord ſaith, Exod. 3.7. <hi>I haue ſurely ſeene the trouble of my people which are in Egypt, &amp; haue heard their crie, becauſe of their task-maiſters, and I know their ſorrowes.</hi> And this is againe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by <hi>Stephen,</hi> Act. 7.34. <hi>I haue ſeene, I haue ſeene the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I haue heard their groning:</hi> implying thereby, that when they were able to do no more, yet the holy Spirit of God made them able to ſigh and to grone to God.</p>
               <p>And indeed the holy Spirit of God once vouchſafed to Gods children, he neuer altogether forſakes them, <label type="milestone">

               <p>That the verie ſighes and grones of the hearts of Gods children in the time of their great troubles and diſtreſſes, are effectuall prayers to God.<note place="margin">The verie ſighes and grones of Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their great afflictions are effectuall prayers to God.</note> When the ſpirits of Gods children are ſo daunted and ſo ouerwhelmed in the time of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and trials, as they are not able to vtter a word to God in prayer, then are the verie ſighes, and ſobs, and grones

And ſuppoſe they cut his tongue out of his head, yet his heart can ſtill ſigh and grone to the Lord, and his ſighes and grones are lowd and ſtrong cries in the eares of the Lord. And be it ſo that a child of God lyes on his bed of ſickneſſe, and is ſo weake as his ſpeech failes him, or is ſo full of paine as that the bitterneſſe of his paines doth ſwallow vp his words, and he is not able to vtter a word in prayer to God, yet let him conſider, that if he do but ſigh and grone to the Lord, his verie ſighes and grones are effectuall prayers and lowd cryes in the eares of the Lord, and do moue the Lord to much pitie and compaſſion towards him. Yea know to thy comfort, thou that art a child of God, thou being vnder the hand of God in ſickneſſe, and ſo weakened in thy bodie, or ſo oppreſſed with paine, as thou art not able to vtter a word in prayer to God, yet thou ſighing and groning to the Lord, thy ſighes and grones do make as it were the holy bowels of the Lord to earne within him, as the Lord himſelfe ſpeakes, Ier. 31.20. and the Lord hath then a moſt tender and fatherly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to thee.

Much more is it ſo with the Lord, he is the Father of mercie, and the God of all pitie and compaſſion; and he looking on his poore child ſo weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in bodie, or ſo oppreſſed with paine, as he is not able to expreſſe and to make knowne by words, but lyes ſighing and groning vnder the burthen, doubtleſſe his holy bowels are then much more enlarged towards his child, and he is then much more moued with pitie and compaſſion towards his
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:492:299"/> child, then any earthly father, though he be of moſt tender bowels, can be towards his child. And that may yeeld matter of ſweet comfort to euery poore child of God, when he is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hand of God in ſo great affliction as he is not able to ſpeake, but his tongue cleaues to the roofe of his mouth, and his words are ſwallowed vp; yet he ſighing and groning to the Lord, his very ſighes and grones are loud and ſtrong cries in the eares of the Lord: and the conſideration of that may miniſter matter of ſingular comfort to him.<note place="margin">A neceſſarie caueat.</note> Yet let none abuſe this ground of comfort, to make him ſluggiſh, and to make him reſt onely in the wiſhes and deſires of his heart, and to thinke that a mentall prayer is ſufficient at all times, and to pleade as ſome graceleſſe perſons do, that though he open not his mouth to God, but goes to his meate and to his bed like a beaſt, yet he prayes to God in his heart, and he can pray to God in his bed halfe awake and halfe aſleepe. If any ſo ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from this ground of comfort, he ſauours it not to his comfort and ſaluation, but to his hurt and damnation. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member we this, that then are the deſires of the heart and the ſighes and grones of a child of God, effectuall prayers to God and accepted of the Lord, when through the greatneſſe of the affliction, and the bitterneſſe of the paine, his mouth is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to vtter a word in prayer to God: then are the ſighes, and ſobs, &amp; gronings of the heart of a child of God, loud cries in the eares of the Lord. That is to be thought on for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of euery poore child of God, onely then when he is vnder the hand of God in ſome grieuous affliction, and cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his mouth to vtter the words of prayer to the Lord.

Now God is ſaid to ſearch the hearts by way of ſimilitude, ſpoken after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, who vſe to ſearch out things which they deſire to know exactly and perfectly: and ſo God is ſaid to ſearch the hearts, not that he need to ſearch them that he may know them, for he knoweth them moſt perfectly; and becauſe he knowes them moſt perfectly, euen as exactly and perfectly, yea more exactly and perfectly then men do things they haue ſearched out moſt diligently and moſt narrowly, he is ſaid to be the ſearcher of the hearts: and by the word <hi>hearts,</hi> we are here to vnderſtand the ſoules of men, and whatſoeuer is

               <p>Firſt the deſcription of God here giuen by the Apoſtle comes to be conſidered, that he ſearcheth the hearts of men: and the point hence is that which is hereby meant and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Apoſtle, namely.</p>

               <p>Now then to make vſe of this, it is a point of large and of excellent vſe. And firſt the conſideration of this truth may ſerue as a bridle to keepe men backe from iudging the hearts of others, and from taking on them to iudge their hearts to be naught whoſe liues they ſee to be holy and good,<note place="margin">Reproofe of ſuch as iudge their hearts to be naught, whoſe liues they ſee to be holy &amp; good.</note> and they ſee no apparent euill from them. Indeed I grant that a man may lawfully iudge one that is openly vile and prophane, to be as he is, and as he ſees him, to be a ruffian, to be a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, and ſuch like. Though prophane perſons would faine hide themſelues vnder this couert, that forſooth you muſt not iudge: and do you know my heart? yet ſuch an one may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be ſo iudged of as he is; and we haue ground for it, Pſal. 15.4. <hi>In whoſe eyes a vile perſon is contemned.</hi> But it is a common practiſe of wicked and graceleſſe perſons, to take on them to iudge ſuch as are holy and religious, and vnreprouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, euen to iudge of their inwards, of their very hearts, and to cenſure them to be hypocrites and diſſemblers. Well, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it whoſoeuer thou art, ſeeſt thou one holy and religious, and one endeuouring to keepe a good conſcience in all things, and doſt thou take on thee to ſit in iudgement on ſuch an ones heart and conſcience, and to iudge ſuch an one to be an hypocrite? thou takeſt on thee the place and office of God himſelfe, and thou inchrocheſt on his right. It is proper to God alone to know the inwards and ſecrets of mens hearts, and thou taking on thee to ſeate thy ſelfe in his chaire, and in his ſeate of iudgement, thou takeſt a wrong courſe, yea a courſe that will bring downe vengeance from God on thine owne ſoule; the Lord cannot endure it, that thou ſhouldeſt incroach on his right, and on his peculiar: and thou ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is ſtronger then thou, and he will iuſtle thee downe to the bottome of hell; and therefore take heed of it: <hi>Who art thou that iudgest another mans ſeruant? he ſtandeth or falleth to <label type="milestone">

                  <note place="margin">It is not enough to auoid open groſſe ſinnes, and to retaine foule boſome ſinnes.</note> Rom. 14.4.</p>
               <p>Againe, this truth, that God perfectly knowes the ſecret thoughts, imaginations, intents and purpoſes of the minds
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:492:302"/> of men, and is acquainted with all the inward motions of their hearts, ought to teach vs not to pleaſe our ſelues onely in this, that we auoid open groſſe ſinnes, ſuch as would blot and blemiſh our liues in the ſight of men, when notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we haue within vs foule boſome ſinnes, and our hearts are defiled with wicked and vngodly thoughts, thoughts of pride, of ſelfe-loue, of couetouſneſſe, of malice, of vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſuch like. If we ſo do, we deceiue our ſelues, the Lord ſees and knowes, not onely outward groſſe ſinnes, but the moſt inward and hidden corruptions of our hearts. Yea conſider with thy ſelfe, that the Lord knowes thine heart more perfectly then thou thy ſelfe doſt or canſt do, though thou be moſt carefull in ſearching into it; and that made <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> crie out, Pſal. 19.12. <hi>Cleanſe me from my ſecret faults:</hi> and therefore be thou carefull, not onely to auoyd open groſſe ſinnes, but alſo to purge thine heart of all wicked thoughts, and remember this, that the Lord ſees them, and knowes them, and will bring euery ſecret thing to iudgement. Yea, the ground of truth now deliuered muſt teach vs, not onely to do good duties, (an hypocrite may do them) but we muſt labour to approue our ſoules to God in the doing of them. For why, the Lord ſees and knowes thy inwards, he knowes with what heart thou comeſt to the Church, yea with what heart thou heareſt the word, and receiueſt the Sacraments, with what heart thou prayeſt in publicke or in priuate, with what heart thou doſt any good dutie, whether thou doſt it in ſinceritie of heart, in conſcience and obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, in reuerence to his holy maieſtie, with a heart ſeeking his glorie, and whether thou do it with an heart prepared, or for faſhion &amp; cuſtome, or no, as thouſands do: they come before the Lord, they ſeeme to be willing to heare his word and to do it, but if one were able to looke into their hearts, he ſhould ſee that they are taken vp with thoughts of the world, yea ſometimes with malicious and ill thoughts againſt the Preacher, eſpecially if he touch them, and reproue them for their darling ſinnes. Now how dareſt thou giue way to ſuch thoughts? the Lord ſees them, and he knowes them,
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:492:303"/> thou canſt not bleare his eyes, and he ſeeing them, it is more then if all the men in the world were priuie to them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labour thou to approue thine heart to the Lord in the doing of euery good dutie. If thine heart witneſſe againſt thee and condemne thee, then as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, 1. Ioh. 3.20. <hi>God is greater then thine heart, and he will much more condemne thee.</hi> Take heed then of halting and diſſembling with the Lord.</p>

Yet they may then ſend vp to heauen their minds and meanings, and their complaints in ſighes and grones, and that in the preſence of their moſt malicious and ſpitefull enemies, and in the hearing of their cruell perſecutors.

               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe, it may be the caſe is ſo with a child of God, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnder the hand of God in great diſtreſſe, as though he go about to pray to the Lord, and he thinkes with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſurely this or that I will craue at the hands of God, and yet by reaſon of weakeneſſe and ſhortneſſe of his memorie, or through the diſtemper of his bodie, ſome thing that he meant to pray for is forgotten, and he onely ſighes and grones to God, the holy Spirit of God ſtirring him vp ſo to do, ſhall that forgetfulneſſe preiudice him in his ſuite to the Lord? No, no, though he haue forgotten the thing that he meant to aske, yet the Lord who ſearcheth the hearts of men, he knowes what he would haue well inough, euen by his ſighes and grones; and thoſe ſighes and grones of his are not in vaine, they vaniſh not away as ſmoke in the aire: no, they aſcend vp to the Lord in heauen, and he is able to find out the meaning of his owne good Spirit in them: and that may be matter of
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:492:305"/> great comfort to a child of God in that particular caſe. Yet let none hereupon take occaſion willingly to let his minde wander from the things he prayes for, and to pray careleſly and looſely; if he ſo do, he offers <hi>the ſacrifice of a foole,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.17. Labour thou to keepe thy mind cloſe to the things thou prayeſt for, and in praying, ſet thy ſelfe ſeriouſly to mind what thou craueſt at the hands of the Lord; and then if through the weakeneſſe of thy memorie, or ſome diſtemper of thy bodie by ſome ſudden pang, thou forget ſome thing thou didſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to pray for, yet thou ſighing and groning in regard of thy forgetfulneſſe, the Lord will paſſe by thy weakeneſſe, and he knowes well inough what thou wouldſt haue by thy ſighes and grones, and he will accept of them as pleaſing to him, and as if thou hadſt made thy caſe knowne to him in words. And that may be matter of great comfort to thee in that particular caſe.</p>
               <p>We are now to come to the reaſons by which the Apoſtle proues that the prayers and ſighes of Gods children, ſent forth by the helpe of the Spirit of God, are knowne and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the Lord: as firſt this, That they are the prayers and ſighes of the Saints: <hi>For he maketh requeſt for the Saints,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, that is, as we ſhewed, for that the ſame holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God cauſeth, ſtirreth vp, and enableth ſuch as are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the bloud of Chriſt, and ſanctified by his grace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed to the image of God, to make requeſts to God for themſelues. Now from hence in that the Apoſtle brings this as a reaſon why the prayers and ſighes of Gods children are knowne and accepted of the Lord, becauſe they are the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and the ſighes of the Saints, of ſuch as are cleanſed by the bloud of Chriſt, and ſanctified by his grace, we are giuen to vnderſtand thus much.</p>
               <p>That the prayers and ſighes of ſuch as are ſanctified, and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>4</label> onely of ſuch as are ſanctified by the holy Spirit of God,<note place="margin">Onely the prayers and ſighes of the Saints of God are accepted of the Lord.</note> and renewed according to his image in a meaſure of holineſſe, are accepted of the Lord and pleaſing to him. Onely the prayers and ſighes of the Saints of God, who are deare and precious in the ſight of God, are the prayers and ſighes the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proues
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:492:306"/> of, and the prayers and ſighes that are auaileable with the Lord. And to this purpoſe we haue plentifull euidence of Scripture. Prou. 15.8. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith in expreſſe termes, <hi>The prayer of the righteous is acceptable to the Lord.</hi> And ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, Iam. 5.16. <hi>The prayer of a righteous man auaileth much:</hi> it is of great force with the Lord. Iob 42.8. the Lord himſelf bids <hi>Iobs</hi> friends offer burnt offerings for themſelues, and withall he tels them, that <hi>his ſeruant Iob ſhould pray for them:</hi> who being an holy man he would accept of his prayers for them. Pſal. 66.18.19. ſaith <hi>Dauid, If I regard wickedneſſe in mine heart, the Lord will not heare me: but God hath heard me, and conſidered the voice of my prayer:</hi> As if he had ſaid, I not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding wickednes in my heart, the Lord hath heard me. And hence it is that the Apoſtle exhorts, 1. Tim. 2.8. <hi>That men lift vp pure hands in prayer</hi> to God. And 2. Tim. 2.19. <hi>That euerie one that calleth on the name of Chriſt, ſhould depart from iniquitie.</hi> And this <hi>Dauid</hi> profeſſeth that he would do when he came to the Lords altar, Pſal. 26.6. <hi>I will waſh mine hands in innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie O Lord, and compaſſe thine altar.</hi> And we find, Iſai. 1.15. the Lord doth proteſt againſt his people the Iewes, that <hi>when they ſhould ſtretch out their hands to him he would hide his eyes from them: and though they ſhould make long prayers, he would not heare, becauſe their hands were full of bloud:</hi> they were defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and came before him in their bloud. And to theſe might be added many other teſtimonies of Scripture, clearing and confirming the truth of the point in hand, that onely the prayers and ſighes of the Saints of God, euen of ſuch as are ſanctified by the holy Spirit of God, and renewed according to Gods image in a meaſure of holineſſe, are accepted of the Lord, and thoſe onely are the prayers and ſighes that the Lord approues of, and that are auaileable with the Lord: and the reaſons and grounds of it are theſe.</p>

And againe, if the wicked do obtaine the good things from God that they pray for, yet they are but temporarie good things, as reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning grace at the beſt, and they receiue them not truly and properly to their owne good, but rather to the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and they do fearefully abuſe them to their owne hurt and deſtruction. <label type="milestone">

And therefore doubtleſſe the prayers and ſighes of wicked and prophane perſons are not pleaſing to the Lord: the holy Ghoſt makes it knowne in expreſſe termes, that their prayers are abhominable, Prou. 15.8. the Lord abhors their ſighes, and what comfort then can they find in going to the Lord in prayer in the time of their need and diſtreſſe? and the caſe of wicked and graceleſſe perſons in the time of their great diſtreſſe is miſerable and fearefull. And conſider it thou that art a prophane perſon, a drunkard, a blaſphemer, or the like, thou canſt not find that a refuge and a comfort to thee in the time of thy great diſtreſſe, which Gods children find to be a ſpeciall meanes of comfort to them in their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt afflictions: namely, prayer, and ſighing, and groning to the Lord.

Alas thou maiſt be cut ſhort, and not able to open thy mouth to the Lord: but admit thou be able to ſigh and grone, yea to roare, and crie, and yell, yea to vtter words of prayer, and to make an excellent prayer for the matter of it; yet thy ſighing and thy crying, thy roaring and thy prayers will not then be accepted of the Lord, the Lord will not then heare thee, as he threatens, Ezech. 8.18. Thy ſighing and thy groning are not the ſighes and grones of a Saint and an holy one, but the ſighes and grones of a prophane one, and they are odious and hatefull to the Lord. And it is iuſt with the Lord in the time of thy need, and in the time of thy diſtreſſe, to reiect thy ſighes and grones, and not to regard them, becauſe thou refuſeſt to heare him when he cals to thee in the miniſterie of his word; as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, Prou. 28.9. <hi>He that turneth away his eare from hearing the Law, euen his prayer ſhall be abhominable.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thinke not thou, whoſoeuer thou art, that art hardened in

<pb n="607" facs="tcp:492:308"/> himſelfe to ſeeke the Lord in prayer. It is an idle fancie, and take we notice on this ground of truth, that it is no eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to pray as we ought.<note place="margin">No eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to pray as we ought.</note> Indeed to pray formally, and to ſay prayers (as ſome vſe to ſpeake,) is an eaſie matter, but to pray truly, with knowledge, with faith, with feeling, and the like, is a ſpeciall worke of grace, and of the holy Spirit of God, and therefore when we ſet on the exerciſe of prayer, we are to craue the aſſiſtance of the holy Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Now further, it is not to be paſſed by without obſeruation, we are to marke it, that the Apoſtle here ſtiles them whom the holy Spirit of God cauſeth, and ſtirreth vp, and enableth, ſuch as are cleanſed by the bloud of Chriſt, and ſanctified by his grace, and are the children of God, to make requeſt to God for themſelues, by the name and title of Saints; he calls them Saints, whence note we.</p>
               <p>That the name and title of Saints, belongeth not onely to <label type="milestone">

So <hi>Dauid</hi> calls them in expreſſe tearmes, Pſal. 16.3. <hi>My weldoing extendeth not to thee, but to the Saints that are in the earth.</hi> And we find that the Apoſtles do vſually ſtile thoſe to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they write their Epiſtles, by the name of Saints, Rom. 1.7. <hi>To all you that be at Rome, beloued of God, called to be Saints.</hi> 1.

And in many other places we find the name of Saints giuen to ſuch as are truly ſanctified by the holy Spirit of God, and renewd according to his image in ſome meaſure of holineſſe, yet liuing on the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>And if any ſay: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> But how can they who liue here on the face of the earth be truly called Saints, ſeeing they haue not here a

And it is an vſuall thing to giue a man his denomination or name from his better part, and it may be truly giuen him from that which is more excellent and more eminent in him, and therefore they that are truly ſanctified, though but in part, are truly called holy, good, godly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, new creatures, Saints.</p>

               <p>Come we now to a ſecond reaſon, by which the Apoſtle proues, that the prayers and ſighes of Gods children are knowne and accepted of the Lord, in the laſt words of the verſe, <hi>According to God, or according to the will of God:</hi> euen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God reuealed in his word, both for the matter and manner, and ſo after an holy manner, and pleaſing to God. Now the point hence offered is this.</p>
               <p>That onely ſuch prayers are pleaſing to God, as are made <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>7</label> according to the will of God,<note place="margin">Prayers made according to Gods will, are onely ſuch as pleaſe God, &amp; are accepted of him.</note> onely then are our prayers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the Lord and pleaſing to him, when they are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and made according to his will reuealed in his word, both for the matter and for the manner of them. And we haue expreſſe teſtimonie of Scripture to this purpoſe. 1. Ioh. 5.14. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn) is the aſſurance that we haue in him, that if we aske any thing according to his will he heareth vs:</hi> whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we aske agreeable to the will of God we are ſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it. And the Apoſtle Iam. 4.3. he ſaith, <hi>Ye aske and receiue not:</hi> and then he ſubioynes, as the reaſon of it, <hi>becauſe ye aske amiſſe:</hi> as if he had ſaid, you are not carefull to frame your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and your petitions aright, and according to the will of God, and therefore you obtaine not the things you pray for.</p>
               <p>And the reaſons &amp; grounds of this, that onely ſuch prayers
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:492:310"/> are pleaſing to God as are made according to the will of God, are theſe.</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> Firſt the will of God reuealed in his word, is the rule of all good actions, both of pietie towards God, and of loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men; and prayer being an act of pietie, an act of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worſhip of God, it muſt needs then onely be pleaſing to God, when it is framed according to the will of God reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his word.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Firſt, on this ground of truth we may eaſily ſee, that they deceiue themſelues,<note place="margin">Prayers made according to mens owne fancies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe God.</note> who thinke that the Lord likes of their prayers, when indeed they frame their prayers according to their owne minds and fancies, without any ground or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the holy word of God, as the Papiſts do in their praying to Angels and Saints departed, and as many ignorant and ſuperſtitious perſons amongſt vs do in their praying for the dead, as God be with them, Gods peace be with them: yea as many do in their praying for good ſucceſſe when they are in hand with ſome wicked exerciſe, as at cards, or dice, or they are going about ſome ill purpoſe, and ſome wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, or as many do in praying for a bleſſing on their ill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten goods, or the like.

               <p>And for a ſecond vſe, on the ground of truth now deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <label type="milestone">

Then looke thou to it, that they be framed according to the will of God reuealed in his word: craue thou nothing at the hands of God, but that which thou haſt warrant for in the holy word of God, and craue it as the Lord would haue thee to ſeeke and ſue for it at his hands. And for more particular direction,<note place="margin">How our prayers are framed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods will.</note> know that thou muſt onely pray for thoſe things that concerne the glorie of God, and ſuch things as concerne thine owne good in this life, and thine owne euerlaſting ſaluation in the life to come; and thou muſt craue good things the Lord hath promiſed in his word, and as the Lord hath promiſed them; things that are abſolutely promiſed, and things abſolutely neceſſary to ſaluation, abſolutely; and things promiſed conditionally, with condition, and no further then the Lord in his wiſedome ſees to be moſt meete for his owne glorie and the good of his children: as temporall good things, freedome from croſſes, freedome from temptations, leſſe principall graces, a meaſure of ſanctifying grace, with ſubiection to the good will of the Lord, both for the time and the manner of granting of them.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this verſe our Apoſtle brings another ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, by which he labours further to arme and to ſtrengthen the beleeuing Romans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the bitterneſſe of the croſſe, and to perſwade them patiently to beare afflictions they ſhould meete withall: and his argument here layd before vs, is taken from the bleſſed iſſue that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions haue in reſpect of true beleeuers: as namely this, they make for their good, and therefore they are to be borne of them with patience and with comfort. Now this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is deliuered by the Apoſtle in the generall; that all things worke together for the beſt to true beleeuers, and therefore their afflictions in this verſe more particularly: we haue three things offered to our conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Three things</note>Firſt, an excellent priuiledge, <hi>All things worke together for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the best,</hi> which the Apoſtle deliuereth as a certaine knowne truth: <hi>We know that all things worke together for the beſt.</hi>

               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the perſons to whom this priuiledge belongs, whom the Apoſtle deſcribes by two ſpeciall properties and qualifications, as firſt they are <hi>ſuch as loue God:</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>ſuch as are called, vnto them that loue God, euen to them that are called.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>And ſo we ſee the drift of the Apoſtle in this verſe, and the generall matter of it. Come we to the opening of the words touching the ſence and meaning of them. <hi>Alſo we know.</hi> That is,<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> I and you, and all true beleeuers, do know, and that aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we know it for a certaine and infallible truth, <hi>That all
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:492:311"/> things.</hi> Some do expound this <hi>all,</hi> diuerſe things, all afflictions and tribulations, all heauie things; which indeed is true, but that expoſition is too ſcant and too narrow: the originall word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> hath a larger extent and ſignification: as I take it, it here comprehends all things, both good and bad, both ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe and proſperous, euen whatſoeuer befals man in this world, and whatſoeuer is within him or without him, either good or euill: all Angels, all diuels, all men, both good and bad, all gifts both of bodie and minde, yea all infirmities, weakeneſſes, defects, and wants both of bodie and mind. And as one ſaith well, euen thoſe things which haue no nature of their owne, but are corruptions of nature, as ſickneſſes, diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and death it ſelfe, <hi>Worke together, or do cooporate or worke.</hi> Not with God, as ſome expound it, for God is not ſo fitly ſaid to worke with his creatures, nor the creatures with God: but the meaning is, that the things among themſelues do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre and meete together in working, all things ioyntly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether worke to the good of Gods children; and though good things and bad things be oppoſite and contrarie one to the other in nature, yet they agree and they ioyne together in working for the good of Gods children, and that by the wonderfull power and prouidence of God, and by his wiſe diſpoſing hand, ſo ordering and ſo diſpoſing of them, as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> ſaid to his brethren, Geneſ. 50.20. <hi>When you thought euill againſt me God dispoſed it to good, that he might bring to paſſe as it is this day, and ſaue much people aliue.

And the good which is here meant, is the good of the ſpiritual eſtate and condition, which is both the eſtate of grace begun in this life, and the eſtate of glorie perfected in the life to come. And ſo the meaning is, that all things worke together for the beſt of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in regard of their ſpirituall eſtate, both for helping for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace and holineſſe in them in this life, and alſo for the furtherance of their eternall happineſſe in the life to come.

Whom he predeſtinate, them alſo he called: and whom he called, them alſo he iuſtified: and whom he iuſtified, them alſo be glorified.</hi> And Gods purpoſe is his eternall and vnchangeable decree of ſauing ſome, which the Apoſtle cals Gods owne purpoſe. 2. Tim. 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaued vs, and called vs with an holy calling, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our workes, but according to his owne purpoſe</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

And ſo the meaning is, euen to them that are called accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods eternall and vnchangeable decree, he hauing purpoſed in himſelfe from all eternitie to bring them to life and ſaluation. Thus then conceiue we the meaning of the Apoſtle in the words of this verſe, as if he had ſaid.</p>

                  <hi>Alſo I and you, and all true beleeuers know, and that aſſuredly, that all things whatſoeuer they be that befall man in this world, whether good or bad, and whatſoeuer is within him, or without

Yea the errours and doubts of others worke for their good, in that they make thoſe truths that are doubted of to be more throughly ſifted and ſearched into. And no points in religion are ſo well cleared as thoſe that haue bene oppoſed by hereticks, as the bleſſed <hi>Trinitie</hi> in the Primitiue Church.

               <p>Outward actuall ſinne and tranſgreſſion, that likewiſe makes for the good of Gods children: when they haue fallen into it, and are recouered out of it by repentance, it makes them more humble and lowly in themſelues, more mild and equall, pitifull and compaſſionate towards others, <hi>Knowing that they themſelues may be tempted,</hi> Galat. 6.1. and more fit to comfort and ſtrengthen others, as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> Luk. 22.32.<note place="margin">Luk. 22.32.</note>

Now things that follow ſinne, as anguiſh, griefe of mind, trouble of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, accuſation for ſinne, theſe alſo worke for the good of Gods children, in that they cauſe them to go out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to denie themſelues, and to ſeeke for comfort where it is to be found, namely, in Chriſt, and in that they make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What fooles then are wicked men, in ſeeking to hurt Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? Wicked men are alwayes imagining miſchiefe againſt Gods children, and are euer ſeeking to do them hurt by all the meanes they can: but poore ſoules, all in vaine, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt them in the things wherein they thinke they do them moſt hurt, they are but inſtruments of doing moſt good to them, and all the miſchiefe they do to Gods children, in ſpite of their hearts it turneth to their good, the wiſe diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hand of God ſo ordering it. And if wicked men did know what good they (as inſtruments in the hand of God) do to Gods children when they thinke they do them moſt hurt, without queſtion it would vexe them to the very heart. They (out of their poyſon and malice) intend euill againſt Gods children, and they thinke they do them hurt when they effect their wicked purpoſe, and bring ſome miſchiefe on them, but the Lord in his wiſedome, out of his loue to his children, turneth it to their great good. For example, wicked men reuile Gods children, and perſecute them, and ſay all manner of euill of them for their profeſſion falſly: what do they thereby but exerciſe their faith, their patience, and ſuch like graces, and ſtirre them vp to draw nearer to the Lord, and giue them cauſe of ioy and gladneſſe, and adde to their glorie in heauen, they ſuffering as they ought, as Chriſt ſaith, Math. 5.11.12. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men reuile you, and perſecute you, and ſay all manner of euill againſt you for my ſake falſly: reioyce and be glad, for great is your reward in heauen.</hi> And therefore wicked men or women are but fooles in ſeeking to hurt Gods children.</p>

               <p>Come we now to handle the qualification of the perſons who haue all things working together for the beſt to them, here layed downe more particularly, and to ſtand on them ſeuerally, and in order. And firſt of this, <hi>That they are ſuch as loue God.</hi> All things worke together for the beſt to them that loue God, (ſaith the Apoſtle) that is, as we ſhewed, to them that loue God ſimply for himſelfe, as the fountaine of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the author of all good things, and in their hearts do cleaue to him as the chiefe, and principall, and moſt abſolute and ſoueraigne good. Now then we ſee that the Apoſtle here deſcribes Gods children, who haue all things working together for the beſt to them, by this as a ſpeciall qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they are ſuch as loue God: and no doubt he rather choſe to ſet them out by this then by any other thing, becauſe he here labours to arme the beleeuing Romans againſt the bitterneſſe of the croſſe, and to perſwade them patiently to beare the afflictions they ſhould meete withall. And true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience dowes from the true loue of God immediatly as the next cauſe of it, and as a friend to it. And againe, loue is the beginning of all affections: where there is loue of any thing, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>4</label> we grieue if we want it, we reioyce if we haue it, we grone in hatred of that which hinders vs of it, and the like.<note place="margin">It is a ſpeciall qualification of ſuch as haue al things working to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the beſt, that they loue God.</note> But to come to the point, the point hence offered is this.</p>
               <p>That it is a ſpeciall qualification of Gods children, and of ſuch perſons who haue all things working together for the beſt to them, that they loue God. All and euerie one of Gods children who haue part in this priuiledge, that all things
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:492:320"/> worke together for the beſt to them, are thus qualified, they loue God ſimply for himſelfe, as the fountaine of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in their hearts they cleaue to him as the chiefe and moſt abſolute good. This qualification, euen a true loue of God, is found in all and euerie child of God in ſome meaſure. The Apoſtle ſaith, Gal. 5.6. that <hi>faith worketh by loue:</hi> true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith is a working faith, and it works by loue, that is, by loue both towards Gods and towards men; and where there is true faith, there is alſo a meaſure of true loue both of God and men. Pſal. 116.1. <hi>Dauid</hi> affirmes this of himſelfe, being a deare child of God, that he was thus qualified, euen with a true loue of God: <hi>I loue the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe he hath heard my voice &amp; my prayer.</hi> And Pſal. 31.23. he exhorts all the Saints and children of God to loue the Lord, <hi>Loue ye the Lord all his Saints:</hi> as if he had ſaid, It concernes all the Saints and children of God to loue the Lord. As it is a dutie to which Gods children are ſtirred vp, ſo doubtleſſe it is a thing found in euerie child of God in ſome meaſure, and all and euerie one of Gods children are thus qualified in ſome meaſure, they loue God ſimply for himſelfe, as the fountaine of all goodneſſe: and the grounds of it are theſe.</p>

               <p>On theſe grounds Gods children ſeeing the excellencies
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:492:320"/> of God, and feeling Gods loue ſhed abroad in thir hearts, it muſt needs be that they are thus qualified in ſome meaſure, they loue God ſimply for himſelfe; and this qualification, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a true loue of God, is found in all and euerie child of God in ſome meaſure: and for the vſe and application of this, <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, let this ſerue as a ground to vs of diſcerning of our ſelues, whether we be the children of God or no. By exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our ſelues hereby we may diſcerne whether we be ſo or no; if ſo be thou find thy ſelfe thus qualified, that thou loueſt God ſimply for himſelfe, it is euidence enough to thee that thou art a child of God,<note place="margin">Our louing of God ſimply for himſelfe, is euidence enough to vs that we are Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> but if thou want this qualification, thou haſt no meaſure of true loue of God in thine heart: ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe if thou thinke that thou art a child of God. Now becauſe euerie one will be readie to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, and to take this to himſelfe, that he loues God, yea ſome are ſo confident in this, as if ye aske them whether they loue God or no, they thinke they are wronged, and they ſcorne the queſtion: they loue God, that they do, elſe it were pitie of their liues, &amp; they would be ſorry elſe.<note place="margin">Sixe notes by which we may trie our ſelues whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we truly loue God or no.</note> I will therefore lay before you ſome ſpeciall notes and marks of the true loue of God, by which we may trie our ſelues whether we be ſuch as truly loue God ſimply for himſelfe, or no.</p>
               <p>And firſt, ſuch as truly loue God, they take pleaſure in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and ſpeaking of God, it is the ioy of their hearts to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thinke and to ſpeake of God, of his properties, of his word, and of his workes, and of good things, and they are neuer ſo well as when they are ſpeaking of thoſe things. The ſpouſe in the Canticles ſpends much time in ſpeaking of her belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and ſhe hath neuer ſpoken enough in the praiſe of him, of his parts, of his beautie, of his attire, and the like.</p>
               <p>Secondly, where there is true loue of God, there is a true <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> deſire and a carefull endeuour to pleaſe him, both by doing the good things he commands, and by auoiding the things he forbids, and that at all times, and in all places, both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and priuate, as Chriſt ſaith, Ioh. 14 15. <hi>If ye loue me, keepe my commandements:</hi> and alſo by a willing ſuffering of any thing for his ſake. The Apoſtles reioyced becauſe <hi>they were
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:492:321"/> counted worthie to ſuffer rebuke for the name of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the true loue of God is accompanied with a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging deſire after further vnion with God, and after further fellowſhip and communion with him, and in a delight in the meanes by which we haue here in this life an holy familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with the Lord, as in ſpeaking to God by prayer, and in hearing him ſpeake to vs by his word, and in renewing our vnion and communion with him in the Sacraments. Thus it was with <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 27.4. <hi>One thing haue I deſired of the Lord, that I will require, euen that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the dayes of my life, to behold the beautie of the Lord and to viſite his temple.</hi> And Pſal. 42.1.2. <hi>As the Hart brayeth for the riuers of waters, ſo panteth my ſoule after thee O God. My ſoule thirſteth for God, euen for the liuing God: when ſhall I come and appeare before the preſence of God?</hi> And eſpecially the true loue of God accompanied with a deſire to haue immediate fellowſhip with Chriſt as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Philip. 1.23. <hi>I deſire to be looſed and to be with Chriſt.</hi> And a longing after the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chriſt to iudgement, as the Church ſaith, Reuel. 22.20. <hi>Come Lord Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the true loue of God hath ioyned with it a true zeale of Gods glorie, and an holy indignation againſt any thing that hinders the glorie of God, and tends to his diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Such as truly loue God, they cannot endure to heare his name blaſphemed, or any way diſhonoured. 2. King. 18.37. <hi>Eliachim, Shebna, and Ioah rent their clothes when they heard Rabſhakehraile on the liuing God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, where there is a true loue of God, there is a baſe eſteeme and indeed a contempt of all earthly things, honours, pleaſures, and profits, in reſpect of Gods loue, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid, Pſal. 73.25. <hi>Whom haue I in heauen but thee? and I haue deſired none in the earth with thee.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He counted all things loſſe, and iudged them to be dung,</hi> in compariſon of this, <hi>that he might winne Christ:</hi> and ſo be aſſured of Gods loue to him in Chriſt, Philip. 3.8.9.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Laſt of all, the true loue of God hath euer ioyned with it a true loue of all that beare the image of God, eſpecially of ſuch
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:492:321"/> as beare his image in ſpeciall manner, and are like to God in a meaſure of true holineſſe, and are the children of God, euen becauſe they are his children. 1. Ioh. 4.20. <hi>If any ſay, I loue God, and hate his brother, he is a lyer: for how can he that loueth not his brother whom he hath ſeene, loue God whom he hath not ſeene?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now by theſe notes, let euerie one of vs trie our ſelues,<note place="margin">Particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the notes.</note> let vs deale truly with our ſelues. In triall ſooth not vp thy ſelfe in a conceit that thou art one that truly loueſt God, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is no ſuch matter. Art thou one that takeſt no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in thinking and ſpeaking of God and of good things? Is ſpeech of good things irkſome and tedious to thee? Haſt thou no care to pleaſe God in doing the good things he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and in auoiding the euill things that he forbids? Art thou a drunkard, a blaſphemer, a Sabbath breaker? Doſt thou follow thy pleaſures on the holy Sabbath of the Lord, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king abroad into the fields? Is prayer and hearing of the word of God a burthen to thee? Canſt thou endure to ſee &amp; heare God diſhonoured, his name blaſphemed, and thou art no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing moued with it? Art thou an earth-worme, a couetous perſon, an vſurer? Doſt thou prefer the loue of the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the loue of God? Art thou one that hateſt Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and thou canſt not abide them that beare the image of God, thou art euer girding them, and deriding them, and thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt they are but a companie of fooles, and ſuch like, and doſt thou loue God? No, no, if thou ſo thinke, thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe, there is no dramme of the true loue of God in thee; and yet I dare ſay thou haſt this good conceit of thy ſelfe. Come to one that is a contemner of God and of all goodneſſe, to a drunkard, to a blaſphemer, to an earth-worme, to an vſurer, and ſuch like, to one that hath no delight in the word of God or in holy things, to one that is a ſcoffer of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſaith in plaine termes, they are but a companie of fooles: aske ſuch an one whether he loue God or no, and he will preſently anſwer, that he doth with all his heart, he would be ſorrie elſe, but indeed and truth there is no ſuch matter; ſuch a perſon deceiues himſelfe with a fond conceit. And if thou, whoſoeuer thou art, wouldſt haue good euidence of it,
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:492:322"/> that thou truly loueſt God, thou muſt finde theſe things in thee, that it is the ioy of thine heart to thinke and to ſpeake of God and of good things, that thou haſt a true deſire and an holy endeuour to pleaſe God in all things, both by doing the good things he requires, and by auoiding the euill things he forbids; that thou delighteſt in the meanes by which thou maieſt haue an holy familiaritie with the Lord, and in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to God in prayer, that thou haſt a zeale of Gods glorie, thou canſt not endure to heare or ſee God any way diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured; that thou doſt more eſteeme of Gods loue to thee in Chriſt, then of all the riches and treaſures in the world, and that thou loueſt all that beare the image of God, eſpecially ſuch as are like to God in true holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, they are thy <hi>chiefe delight,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith they were his, Pſal. 16.3. If theſe things be in thee, certainly then thou truly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt God, and thou art beloued of God, and thou art a child of God.</p>
               <p>And for a ſecond vſe: is it ſo that all and euerie one of <label type="milestone">

               <p>Now before I leaue this point, I hold it needfull to adde ſomething to that which hath bene alreadie deliuered, and that onely by way of perſwaſion to ſtirre vs vp, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs to the loue of God, being a ſpeciall qualification of
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:492:322"/> all and euerie one of Gods children, and yeelding ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the ſoule in which it is found.<note place="margin">Motiues to ſtirre vs vp to loue God tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in loue to him.</note> It ought to ſtirre vp e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one of vs to labour to haue our hearts poſſeſſed with a true loue of God, and where there is any meaſure of the true loue of God, to labour to increaſe it. And to helpe vs forward herein, conſider we further, that loue is the beſt affection of our hearts, and where can we better beſtow this beſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> then on God? Euerie one will ſet his loue on ſome thing, and is there any thing more worthie our loue then God? Certainly nothing either in heauen or in earth; if we ſet our loue on the world, and content our ſelues in any thing in the world, we abuſe our ſoules, our ſoules are more worth then al the world, yea our loue being ſet on the world, it then periſheth with the thing loued, the time of this world is but ſhort, and <hi>the faſhion of it paſſeth away:</hi> as 1. Corinth. 7.31.</p>
               <p>Againe, conſider we the wonderfull and vnſpeakeable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> goodneſſe of God to vs: what are we, but euen a bundle of Gods benefits? what we are, what we haue in our bodies, in our ſoules, and what we hope for, all is from the goodneſſe of God: he ſo ouerrules all things in heauen and earth, as they worke for our good, we being his children his Angels are for our protection, his Miniſters for our edification, and all things for our good. He deliuers vs from all euill, and keepes vs from falling into euill, yea he hath made vs capable of happineſſe, whereas he hath refuſed the Angels in nature farre aboue vs, and he will in his good time bring vs into the poſſeſſion of his heauenly kingdome. Oh then the conſideration of theſe things, and many other that might be remembred, euen the conſideration of the Lords excellencie, and that we cannot better beſtow our beſt affection then on him, and that it is an abaſement of our ſoules if we ſet our loue on the world, and content our ſelues in any thing in the world, and the due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Lords vnſpeakeable goodneſſe to vs, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our bodies, our ſoules, this life, or the life to come; oh theſe ought to ſway with vs, and to ſtirre vs vp to labour to find our hearts poſſeſſed with a true loue of God, and finding
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:492:323"/> any meaſure of true loue of God alreadie in our hearts, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to increaſe it, yea to come to ſuch a meaſure of the loue of God, and to ſuch a zeale of his glorie, as was in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> who could haue bene content to loſe heauen rather then God ſhould loſe his glorie: this we ought to labour for, and to endeuour to come to.</p>
               <p>I proceed, come we now to the ſecond qualification of the perſons who haue all things working for the beſt to them, namely, <hi>That they are ſuch as are called:</hi> all things worke together for the beſt to them that loue God, euen to them that are called of his purpoſe, ſaith the Apoſtle, that is, as we ſhewed, to them that are effectually called, and by the worke of the holy Spirit of God are brought, through the preaching of the word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from ignorance and vnbeliefe to true knowledge and faith in Chriſt. Now here we are to marke the coherence of theſe two qualifications, <hi>To them that loue God, and to them that are called of his purpoſe:</hi> the Apoſtle ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynes one of theſe as an explication of the other: <hi>All things worke together for the beſt to them that loue God.</hi> And who are theſe? Why ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>Thoſe that are called, euen to them that are called of his purpoſe.</hi> Whence in the firſt place we are giuen to vnderſtand thus much.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>5</label> That the true loue of God is found onely in ſuch as are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called.

Reade Galat. 5.22. we there find <hi>loue,</hi> whereby no doubt the Apoſtle meanes the true loue both of God and men, reckened vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the fruites of the Spirit. <hi>The fruite of the Spirit</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is loue.</hi> The true loue of God is a particular fruite ſent out from the holy Spirit of God as the roote of it, and that onely in ſuch as are ſanctified, and effectually wrought on by the Spirit, for ſuch the Apoſtle here ſpeakes of; and ſo found onely in ſuch as are effectually called. 1. Tim. 1.5. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The end of the commandement is loue:</hi> that is, true loue both of God and men; and then he ſubioynes, <hi>Out of a
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:492:323"/> pure heart and of a good conſcience, and of faith vnfained:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he makes knowne that the true loue of God it comes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from a pure heart, from an heart purged by faith: for <hi>faith purifieth the heart,</hi> as we haue it, Act. 15.9. and from a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſoule, and ſo doubtleſſe the true loue of God is found onely in ſuch perſons as are effectually called, and in ſuch are wrought one by the word and Spirit of God: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and grounds of this truth are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there is no true loue of God in men by nature, the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> will and affections of men muſt be altered and changed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there be any place for the true loue of God: the heart of man in the naturall ſtate of it is oppoſite and contrarie, and carried againſt God and againſt all goodneſſe, and there is no dramme of the true loue of God in the heart by nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the true loue of God euer followeth an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> and perſwaſion of Gods loue: when a man by faith layeth hold on the loue of God, and beleeues that he is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God, and that God is his God and Father in Chriſt: then is his heart affected with the true loue of God.</p>
               <p>Againe, according to that 1. Ioh. 4.19. <hi>We loue him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> he loued vs first.</hi> On theſe grounds it followes ſtrongly and vndeniably, that the true loue of God is found onely in ſuch as are effectually called, and onely ſuch perſons truly loue God, as are effectually called, and wrought on by the word and Spirit of God, and brought from ignorance and vnbeleefe to knowledge and true faith in Chriſt, and none but ſuch.</p>
               <p>Now for the vſes of it, firſt this truth meets with that erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious conceit of the Papiſts, who hold and teach, that the firſt <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> act of loue is in vs by nature,<note place="margin">That true loue is in vs by nature, is a Popiſh error.</note> and that we haue in vs by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture an inclination to loue both God and men, and that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſecond act or exerciſe of loue is from grace; this is but their conceit, and cannot ſtand with the euidence and truth of the word of God, and with the truth of doctrine now deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I leaue it, and for the vſe of it to our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo that the true loue of God is found onely in ſuch as <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> are effectually called,<note place="margin">They are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued who thinke they haue loued God from their infancie &amp; childhood.</note> and onely ſuch perſons truly loue God as are effectually called and wrought on by the word and
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:492:324"/> Spirit of God, and brought from ignorance and vnbeleefe to knowledge and true faith in Chriſt, and none but ſuch? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then it muſt needs follow from hence, that they deceiue themſelues, who thinke they haue truly loued God from their very infancie and childhood, and euer ſince they knew any thing. It is a common ſpeech of ignorant perſons, and of ſuch as continue in blindneſſe and in the hardneſſe of their hearts, and neuer yet felt the power of grace in their owne ſoules, working in them a through alteration and change, that they loue God with all their hearts, and that they haue lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued God euer ſince they knew their right hand from the left. Poore ſoules they are exceedingly deceiued, the truth of God now deliuered makes knowne to them, if they will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, that there is no ſuch matter. The true loue of God is found onely in ſuch as are effectually called and wrought on by the word and Spirit of God, and are brought from ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and vnbeleefe to knowledge and true faith in Chriſt. And take thou notice of it, thou that ſayeſt thou haſt loued God euer ſince thou kneweſt any thing, and yet thou art an ignorant perſon, and thou haſt neuer yet felt any true change in thine owne ſoule by the worke of grace, thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe, and of thine owne mouth I dare be bold to iudge of thine heart in this particular, and to tell thee there is no iot of true ſauing grace in thine heart. Thou art ignorant of God, and of the things of God, thy ſpeech bewrayes it; and being yet in thy naturall ignorance and blindneſſe, certainly thou art not effectually called, and ſo it is not poſſible that thou ſhouldeſt truly loue God. Nay, admit it be ſo that thou haſt attained ſome knowledge of God and of good things, thou liuing vnder the meanes of knowledge, and thou art able to ſpeake of God and of good things, yet vnleſſe that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be ſanctified, and haue wrought on thee in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a through change, both in heart and life, thou art as farre from louing God truly, as thou waſt before: it is not thy knowledge of God and of good things, though it be great, that will euidence to thee to thy comfort, that thou art one truly louing God. No, no, it is thy effectuall calling that will
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:492:324"/> giue thee comfort in that reſpect; one of theſe ariſeth from the other, when the Lord cals any effectually, he powres his grace into him, and by the ſame grace he frames his heart to loue his holy Maieſtie: and therefore if thou wouldeſt be ſure that thy loue of God is as it ought to be, euen a true loue of God, and that thou art a man or a woman truly louing God, looke to thy effectuall calling, and neuer reſt till thou fin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that thou art effectually called. If thou find that thou art effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called and wrought on by the word and Spirit of God, and brought from ignorance and vnbeliefe to ſauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſauing faith in Chriſt, then thy loue of God though it be but weake, and in a poore meaſure, yet it comes from a right ground, and from the true naturall mother of it, and there is comfort in it.</p>
               <p>I will now as the Lord ſhall enable me, ſtand on this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond qualification more particularly. The Apoſtle here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes Gods children, who haue all things working toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the beſt to them, that they are ſuch as loue God, and againe, that they are ſuch as are called of his purpoſe, that is, effectually called and wrought on by the word and Spirit of God. We ſee then which is the point I will ſtand on.</p>
               <p>That it is a ſpeciall qualification of Gods children, and of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>6</label> ſuch perſons as haue all things working together for the beſt vnto them, that they are effectually called: all and euery one of them who haue part and portion in this worthy priuiledge, that all things worke for the beſt vnto them, they are thus qualified, they are effectually called,<note place="margin">All and euery one who haue part in this worthy priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that all things worke together for the beſt to them, they are effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called.</note> and they are wrought on by the word and Spirit of God, and they are brought from ignorance and vnbeliefe, to true knowledge and true ſaith in Chriſt. And for the clearing and confirming of this, reade Pſal. 65.4. <hi>Dauid</hi> there deſcribes the bleſſed man, namely, the child of God, to be <hi>one whom the Lord chuſeth, and cauſeth to come to him,</hi> one whom the Lord doth in his free loue chuſe to make him a member of his Church, and his adopted child, and then doth moue his heart by his word, and by his holy Spirit, to come to him, and that effectually doth cauſe him to come to him, and to receiue his mercie. Pſal. 40.6.7. <hi>Dauid</hi>
                  <pb n="640" facs="tcp:492:325"/> ſaith, <hi>When his eare was prepared, he anſwered loe, I come.</hi> The Lord wrought on his heart by his good Spirit, and called him by his word, and he anſwered the Lords call, he was effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wrought on. Act. 2.41. we reade of three thouſand ſoules that were added to the Church, and became true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, and ſo the children of God, they receiued the word of <hi>Peter</hi> preaching, and they were baptized, they were brought to true knowledge and true faith in Chriſt, they receiued the Sacrament of Baptiſme as a ſeale of that faith. And the like we find recorded of <hi>Lydia,</hi> Acts 16.14.15. <hi>The Lord opened her heart, and ſhe receiued the word</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> preached vnto her, and ſhe was effectually called, ſhe was brought to true knowledge, and to true faith in Chriſt. 1. Pet. 2.9. we find that the Apoſtle deſcribes the peculiar people of God, and ſuch as are indeed the children of God, that they are <hi>called out of darkneſſe into the Lords maruellous light:</hi> they are brought from ignorance to true knowledge, and out of the ſtate of nature into the ſtate of grace. And ſo ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of the beleeuing Epheſians, Epheſ. 5.8. <hi>Ye were once darkneſſe, but are now light in the Lord.</hi> We ſee then ſufficient euidence of Scripture clearing and confirming this truth: that it is a ſpeciall qualification of all and euery one of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who haue part in this excellent priuiledge, that all things worke together for the beſt to them, that they are effectually called, they are wrought on by the word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and they are brought from ignorance and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe to true knowledge, and true faith, they are ſuch as haue anſwered the call of God in the miniſterie and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of his word: and it muſt needs be ſo, the reaſon of it is this.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> Becauſe otherwiſe there is no knowne difference betweene them and the reprobate: a difference there is betweene Gods choſen and the reprobate, euen before their calling, they are then beloued of God, and they are knowne to him to be in the number of his elect afterwards to be called, but there is no difference betweene them and the reprobate, knowne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to themſelues or to others, till they be effectually called,
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:492:325"/> till then they are in bondage vnder ſinne, as the reprobate are, and their life and conuerſation differs not from the life and conuerſation of the reprobate: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. 2.2.3. <hi>Wherein in time paſt ye walked according to the courſe of this world, and after the Prince that ruleth in the aire, euen the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedience, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom ye had your conuerſation in time paſt, in the luſts of your fleſh, in fulfilling the will of the fleſh and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath as well as others.</hi> 1. Cor. 6.11. <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are iuſtified in the name of the Lord Ieſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> And therefore that there may be a manifeſt and knowne difference betweene Gods children and the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, it muſt needs be that all and euery one of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are effectually called, and are wrought on by the word and Spirit of God, and are brought from ignorance and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe to true knowledge, and to true faith, and they are ſuch as haue anſwered the call of God in the miniſterie of his word.</p>
               <p>Now then for the vſe, this alſo in the firſt place may ſerue <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> as a ground of diſcerning of our ſelues, whether we be the children of God or no.<note place="margin">How we may diſcerne whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be the children of God or no.</note> And let euerie one of vs trie our ſelues by this: If in triall thou findeſt that thou art effectually called, and that thou haſt indeed anſwered the call of God in the miniſterie of his word, and thou art brought from ignorance and vnbeliefe to true knowledge, and true faith, then thy caſe is good, thou art a child of God: but if thou find it not thus with thee, eſpecially hauing liued vnder the ſound of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, vnder the miniſterie and preaching of it a long time, ſurely then thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe if thou thinke thou art a child of God. Now becauſe herein many deceiue themſelues, and many thinke their caſe good, they are called home, they are reclaimed and wrought on by the word and Spirit of God, and brought from ignorance and vnbeliefe to true knowledge &amp; true faith, becauſe haply they haue gotten ſome knowledge, and they auoyd ſome ſinne they were heretofore giuen to, or they now runne not into that outrage they were
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:492:326"/> wont to do, which things I ſpeake not againſt, but herein ſome reſt, and thinke their caſe good, and ſo deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: I will therefore make knowne ſome ſpeciall notes and markes of effectuall calling, by which we may trie our ſelues, whether we be effectually called and wrought on, or no.<note place="margin">Seuen notes by which we may trie whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be effectually called or no.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt then ſuch as are effectually called, their eyes are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and they ſee their owne wretched eſtate by nature, and their curſed ſtate by ſinne, and they ſee alſo the truth of Gods promiſes offered and tendered to them in the Goſpell, and they haue power giuen them to come out of their miſerie, and to apply the promiſes, and by faith to make them parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to themſelues, euen by true <hi>faith purifying their hearts.</hi> Acts 26.18. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he was ſent to the Gentiles to this purpoſe: <hi>To open their eyes that they might turne from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan vnto God, that they might receiue forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and inheritance among them which are ſanctified by faith,</hi> and true <hi>faith purifieth the heart.</hi> Act. 15.9.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, effectuall calling is euer ioyned with an hatred of former ſinnes, and with a ſtriuing againſt them, yea with an hatred and loathing of thoſe ſinnes that haue bene moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and moſt delightſome to men or women, and to which their nature is moſt inclining: the remembrance of thoſe ſins is now grieuous and lothſome to them. Rom. 12.9. it is the exhortation of the Apoſtle, <hi>abhorre that which is euill:</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſtaine from it, but hate and loath it as hell it ſelfe, for ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, effectuall calling hath euer ioyned with it graces befitting that calling. As when any is called of God to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular calling, he is endued with gifts fit for the ſame: ſo doubtleſſe ſuch as are called out of the ſtate of nature into the ſtate of grace, they are fitted with gifts for that calling, and made able in ſome meaſure to walke worthie that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as the Apoſtle exhorts, Epheſ. 4.1. <hi>I pray you that ye walke worthie of the vocation whereunto ye are called.</hi> Yea they are made able, and they do expreſſe the power of grace in
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:492:326"/> their particular callings: they glorifie God, and they ſerue God in doing the duties of their callings, as the Apoſtle ſaith ſeruants do in ſeruing their maiſters, Coloſ. 3.4.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, where there is effectuall calling, there is a choyce <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of good companie, and a delight in the companie of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and a ſtrangeneſſe to wicked companie, he that is <hi>called out of the world,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith (Ioh. 15.19.) all his are, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not loue the world, he hath ſmall ioy in it, as the world hath ſmall ioy in him. Pſal. 26.4.5. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>I haue not haunted with vaine perſons, neither kept companie with the diſſemblers,</hi> I haue hated the aſſembly of the euill, and haue not companied with the wicked. And Pſal. 119.63. <hi>I am a companion of all them that feare thee and keepe thy precepts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, where there is effectuall calling, there is a ſpeciall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> prizing of the meanes by which it hath bene wrought: he that hath bene called by the word, he loues the word, and eſpecially the Goſpell.

               <p>The laſt note of effectuall calling, is a precious account of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> that calling, and a thinking more highly of it then of any outward thing.

Haſt thou in thee no hatred of thy former ſinnes, nor ſtriuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them? Doſt thou go on with delight in the practiſe of knowne ſinnes, yea haply being paſt the practiſe of thy beſt pleaſing ſinne, is the remembrance of it pleaſing to thee? Doſt thou ſpeake of it with delight? Doſt thou ſhew forth no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of grace in thy life, in the duties of Chriſtianitie, and in thy particular place and calling? Art thou negligent or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in the workes of thy calling? Doſt thou therein onely ſeeke thy ſelfe, and not the glorie of God? And doſt thou make no choyce of thy companie? Art thou readie to go with any that puts forth his head? Is any one a compariſon for thee, though a drunkard, a blaſphemer, or ſuch like? Haſt thou no delight in the word of God? Doſt thou heare it with a dead heart? Doth thy proſperitie make thee careleſſe of heauenly things, and of holy duties?

And doſt thou preferre the honours and preferments of the world before the high calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus? If it be thus with thee, ſurely then if thou thinke thou art effectually called, and that thou art in the way of life, thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe, and thou haſt yet no good euidence to that purpoſe. And if thou wouldſt be ſure that thou art effectually called, then looke thou find in thy ſelfe the notes before ſpoken of. Are thine eyes opened and cleared?

Haſt thou a care of heauenly things, and art thou conſcionable in the practiſe of holy duties in thy greateſt proſperitie, and the more the Lord doth heape his mercies on thee in outward things, the more carefull thou art of holy duties: and the richer thou art, the holier thou art? And doſt thou hold faſt the profeſſion of Religion in the heate of perſecution, and when it is moſt of all diſgraced? And doſt thou make more account of the high calling of God in Ieſus Chriſt, and of thy calling out of the ſtate of nature into the ſtate of grace, then of all the honours and preferments in the world? Is it thus with thee, and are theſe things in thee? Certainly then thy caſe is good, thou art effectually called and wrought on by the word and Spirit of God; the Lord hath ſet thy feete into the way of life &amp; ſaluation, and thou art going on in the way to heauen, and he wil vndoubtedly in his good time bring thee into the full poſſeſſion of life and glory in heauen: and that may be a ground of ſweet comfort to thee.</p>
               <p>There is yet another vſe to be made of this point before <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> we leaue it, I will adde it in a word.<note place="margin">Comfort for ſuch as finde themſelues effectually called.</note> Is it ſo that effectuall calling is a ſpeciall qualification of Gods children, and all and euerie one of them who haue part in this priuiledge, that all things worke together for the beſt vnto them; they are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called, they are wrought on by the word and Spirit of God, and they are brought from ignorance and vnbeliefe, to
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:492:328"/> true knowledge and true faith? Then here is ground of ſweet comfort for thee, whoſoeuer thou art that findeſt thy ſelfe effectually called. Haſt thou good euidence of thy effectuall calling? Art thou ſure of it that thou art now ſet out of the ſtate of nature into the ſtate of grace? Surely the meditation of that is more comfortable to thee, then to thinke on thy ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or on thy redemption by Chriſt, for that giues thee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of thy election and of thy redemption, and it ſeales vp to thee this comfort, that thou art in the number of Gods choſen, and one redeemed by Chriſt, and that thou ſhalt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſaued. And therfore the Apoſtle 2. Pet. 1.10 exhorts to giue all diligence to make our calling and election ſure: for if we do theſe things we ſhall neuer fall. By making ſure our calling, we make ſure our election, and we come to be 2aſſured of it: and therefore doubtleſſe it is moſt ſweete and moſt comfortable to thee whoſoeuer thou art, if thou be able to ſay, and that truly, I am effectually called, I was thus or thus giuen ouer to ſinne, but now I am not; and eſpecially if thou be able to ſay ſo, and that truly, in reſpect of thy beſt pleaſing ſinne, I was heretofore held vnder the power and tyrannie of this or that ſinne, and I gaue my ſelfe ouer to the practiſe of it with much delight, but now I haue power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; and though ſtrength and abilitie be not wanting to me for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> practiſe of it, yet now I haue no pleaſure in it, I now ſtriue againſt it, and I now auoide all occaſions leading to it, yea it is now a griefe to my ſoule to thinke of it, it is ſo odious and hatefull to me. If thou be able thus to ſay, &amp; that in truth, that is a comfortable thing indeed, that giues thee aſſurance that thou art in the ſtate of grace, and in the way to life and ſaluation; and the conſideration of that may yeeld thee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort both in life and death. And ſo I paſſe from that.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the third and laſt thing layed before vs in this verſe, and that is the ground and cauſe why all things worke together for the beſt to them that loue God, and are effectually called, and that is Gods purpoſe: <hi>We know that all things worke together for the beſt vnto them that loue God, euen to them that are called of his purpoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now in that the Apoſtle here ſaith, effectuall calling is according to Gods eternall purpoſe, I might ſtand to ſhew, that Gods loue to his children is not alwayes concealed, his loue to his children before all times is in time made knowne to them; for it is not an idle loue, but operatiue and working: but I will not ſtand on that. Hence obſerue we in the firſt place thus much.</p>
               <p>That the euidences and ſignes of the happineſſe and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <label type="milestone">

And to this purpoſe we haue further euidence, reade Epheſ. 1.4. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God hath choſen vs in Chriſt before the foundation of the world:</hi> there is the ground of our happineſſe in Gods eternall election out of our ſelues; and then he ſubioynes, <hi>That we ſhould be holy and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame before him in loue.</hi> Thereby making knowne, that true faith and holineſſe, which are things in our ſelues, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidences and ſignes of it that we belong to Gods election and ſhall be ſaued. So likewiſe 2. Tim. 2.19. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The foundation of the Lord,</hi> that is, the eternall purpoſe of God touching ſaluation, in which the ſaluation of Gods elect is found, <hi>Remaineth ſure, and hath this ſeale, the Lord knoweth who are his:</hi> it is ſealed and layed vp in God himſelfe: and then he addes, <hi>Let euerie one that calleth on the name of Chriſt depart from iniquitie:</hi> as if he had ſaid. The ſignes by which any one may be ſure that he belongs to Gods election are in himſelfe, euen true faith, and a ſerious care and endeuour after holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Not to adde further teſtimonie of Scripture to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: the reaſon why the euidences and ſignes of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Gods children are in themſelues, and the ground of it out of themſelues, in Gods eternall and vnchangeable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is.</p>

Were it not follie and madneſſe in any one to lay claime to a piece of land hauing neither hand, nor ſeale, nor word, nor promiſe, nor any deed nor euidence in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world to ſhew for it? Surely ſo is it with many in the world, they lay claime to heauen, and yet they haue neither word, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God to that purpoſe, nor hand nor ſeale of God, they want the ſeale of Gods Spirit, and euidence of grace in their own ſoules. Poore ſoules they deceiue themſelues, and herein doth the diuell delude thouſands in the world, and he takes aduantage on the doctrine of our Church to deceiue them, we teaching (according to the truth) that in the matter of iuſtification in the ſight of God and in the matter of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt go out of our ſelues, and muſt ſeeke for iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſaluation onely in Chriſt: hereupon the diuell takes the hint and deludes thouſands, perſwading them it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent if they fancie to themſelues (for it is no better then a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie) that Chriſt died for them, and that they ſhall be ſaued by the merit of Chriſt, though they neuer find Chriſt in them by the worke of his Spirit, applying his merit to their iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cleanſing them to their ſanctification. Well know it, whoſoeuer thou art, if thou wilt lay claime to happineſſe and ſaluation on a good ground, thou muſt not onely go out of thy ſelfe, and find the ground of it in Gods eternall purpoſe,

Yea know it for a certaine truth, thou muſt find Chriſt a Sauiour to thee, not onely out of thy ſelfe by his merit but alſo in thy ſelfe by the efficacie of his Spirit, and that Chriſt hath not onely ſaued thee from hell, but hath alſo turned thee from ſinne to God; that muſt be an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to thee that thou art in the way to heauen: thinke on it.</p>
               <p>Againe, for a ſecond vſe: is it ſo that the euidences and <label type="milestone">

Surely the due conſideration of this may affoord much comfort to ſuch of Gods children as finde the worke of grace, the euidence of their happineſſe and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but weake and feeble in them,<note place="margin">Comfort to ſuch of Gods children as find the work of grace but weake and feeble in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> and they complaine of the weakeneſſe of it, as indeed it is many times the complaint of a deare child of God: Oh I finde but a poore and weake meaſure of grace in my ſelfe, and it doth much daunt me, yea it makes me many times to doubt of my eſtate. Why, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with thy ſelfe, the worke of grace in thy ſoule is not the ground of thy comfort, it is but onely an euidence and ſigne of it, and of thy happineſſe and ſaluation, and the ground of it is out of thy ſelfe layed vp in Gods eternall purpoſe. Indeed if ſo be the ground of thy comfort and ſaluation lay in thine owne hand, and if thy happineſſe and ſaluation were built on any thing in thy ſelfe as the ground of it, thou mighteſt iuſtly doubt of thy ſtate and ſtanding; but it is not ſo, it is ſet on a better and a more ſure foundation and ground worke, on the eternall and vnchangeable purpoſe of God, and that ſtands faſt and firme for euer. And therefore comfort thy ſelfe, and when thou findeſt thy ſelfe wauering and doubting of thy ſtate, and troubled in regard of the weakeneſſe of grace in thy ſelfe, remember this, that the grace that is in thee is but the euidence and ſigne of thy happineſſe and ſaluation; and being in thee in truth, though but weake, yet it is ſufficient
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:492:330"/> to euidence that to thee, it is not the ground of it: no, the ground of thy comfort and of thy happineſſe and ſaluation, is out of thy ſelfe in Gods eternall purpoſe, and is built on that ground, and that is a foundation moſt firme and ſtable, and immouable, and all the diuels in hell are not able to raze it: and the conſideration of that may be a great comfort to thee.</p>

               <p>Now this truth is of vſe, firſt for confutation; it meets with <label type="milestone">

Thus they labour to obſcure and darken the bright ſhining of Gods free grace in effectuall calling, cleane contrarie to the truth now deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered. I leaue them, and for vſe to our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo that effectuall calling is a free calling? Is it not in <label type="milestone">

Surely then, ſuch as are effectually called are to magnifie the free grace of God, and to aſcribe that worke of their effectuall calling onely to the free grace and mercie of God. Do not thou being effectually called, aſcribe any thing to the goodneſſe of thine owne nature, and thinke with thy ſelfe, I am of a better temper then others, and I haue a better nature then others, and the Lord ſaw ſome goodneſſe in me aboue others, as ſome erronious ſpirits do hold: the
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:492:331"/> Lord ſaw that I would vſe his grace offered to me well, and therefore he hath wrought on me by his word and Spirit. No, no, thinke thus with thy ſelfe, as the truth is, I am no better then others by nature, there is no more goodneſſe in me by nature then in the vileſt miſcreant that liues on the face of the earth, I liued once as others do that are yet in the ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I tooke as great pleaſure in my ſinne as others now do in theirs, and I ranne as faſt in the way to hell as they now runne, and what hath moued the Lord thus to put a difference betweene me and others, as to call me effectually, and to leaue others ſtill in their naturall ſtate and condition? ſurely nothing in me, onely his free grace and goodneſſe: Oh then how am I bound to magnifie the free grace and mercie of God towards me, in working on me effectually by his word and Spirit! Thus art thou to acknowledge and to magnifie the free grace of God, in regard of thy effectuall calling: yea take thou notice of it, thou being effectually called, and ſet out of the ſtate of nature into the ſtate of grace, thou art ſtill to acknowledge the free grace of God in adding one mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grace to another. Though thou be carefull in vſing grace giuen thee, and in the vſe of the meanes that ſerue for the increaſe of it, yet know, the Lord addes one meaſure of grace to another freely, not becauſe thou art good, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is good and gracious; not for thy well vſing of grace, or for the carefull vſe of the meanes, though thou art bound ſo to do, but ſtill of his free grace: the Lord is ſtill free in his working, and in adding one meaſure of grace to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>The Spirit blowes where he liſteth,</hi> as the Lord Ieſus ſaith, comparing him to wind, Ioh. 3.8. he works freely where he will, and when he will, and ſo farre as it pleaſeth him. And therefore thou art to magnifie the free grace of God, and the free working of his Spirit, in adding one meaſure of grace to another.</p>
               <p>Now another concluſion and point offered from hence, that the ground of effectuall calling is Gods eternall purpoſe, and his vnchangeable decree touching the ſaluation of his choſen, is this.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vr Apoſtle hauing in the verſe foregoing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered this ground of comfort, that all things worke together for the beſt to them that loue God, euen to them that are called of his purpoſe, thereby to arme the beleeuing Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans againſt the bitterneſſe of the croſſe, and to perſwade them patiently to beare afflictions; in theſe two verſes he proceeds to proue that all things, euen afflictions, worke for the beſt to thoſe that are called according to Gods eternall purpoſe, and that by two arguments. The firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is layd downe verſe 29. and it is taken from the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie and infallible certaintie of Gods eternall purpoſe, in regard of that which the Lord hath ſet downe in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall purpoſe to bring his choſen to. And it ſtands thus, that God in his eternall purpoſe hath ordained his choſen to be conformable &amp; to be made like to the glorious image of his Sonne; and his purpoſe is vnchangeable, and moſt ſure and certaine, and it is impoſſible that God ſhould be diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of this intention and purpoſe of his, and therefore it muſt needs be that all things worke together for the beſt to them that loue God, and are called of Gods purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument is in verſe 30. I will lay it foorth when we come to the handling of it.</p>
               <pb n="656" facs="tcp:492:333"/>
               <p>Now in this verſe for the generall matter of it, the Apoſtle deliuers firſt this propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Thoſe which God knew before, he predeſtinate them to be conformable to his Sonne; wherein we haue to conſider the ſubiect: <hi>Thoſe which he knew before:</hi> then that which is affirmed of them; that they were predeſtinate, with the determination of the act of predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, to be conformed and made like to the image of his Sonne.</p>
               <p>Then ſecondly, he amplifies this propoſition by adding a limitation of that conformitie, that thoſe which God knew before, he predeſtinated them to be made like to the image of his Sonne, yet ſo as that his Sonne hath and might haue the preheminence, as elder brother, or as firſt begotten, and that they might not be equall to him in that conformitie, in the laſt words of the verſe, <hi>That he might be the firſt borne among many brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>Come we to the opening of the words: <hi>Thoſe which he knew before.</hi> The word <hi>before</hi> here ſignifies, before they had their being, yea before the foundation of the world, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, Epheſ. 1.4. For foreknowledge is aſcribed to God, in reſpect of the creature properly. In reſpect of God there is nothing paſt, nothing to come; all things paſt, and all things to come are preſent to him. Now the Lord is ſaid in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to foreknow things or perſons two wayes.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt generally, by a generall knowledge, whereby God foreknoweth what perſons and things, good and euill, ſhall be in the world: and to come, of which <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeakes, Pſal. 139.16. <hi>Thine eyes did ſee me when I was without forme, for in thy booke were all things written, which in continuance were faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when there was none of them before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, God is ſaid to foreknow by a more ſpeciall fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, which is by a foreknowledge with loue and with approbation; and this is that which the Apoſtle ſpeakes of, 2. Tim. 2.19. <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> The Lord from euerlaſting knoweth his with loue and with approbation. Rom. 11.2. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Hath God caſt away his people which he knew before?</hi> that is, which he before loued and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued;
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:492:333"/> and this foreknowledge of God is here meant. Thoſe which he knew before, that is, thoſe which he did foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and embrace in his eternall loue as his owne, and of his free loue ſet apart to life &amp; ſaluation, <hi>them he alſo predeſtinate,</hi> or fore-ordained, or decreed beforehand. For to deſtinate, is to appoint a thing to a certaine end: and to predeſtinate is to appoint a thing to ſuch an end beforehand; and the Apoſtle here determines the end in the words following. We ſhall not need further to explane the word <hi>predeſtinate,</hi> we ſhall ſpeake more of it in the verſe following. <hi>To be made like or conformable to the image of his Sonne.</hi> This likeneſſe and this conformitie to the image of Chriſt, is not here to be referred either to the bodie of Chriſt, or ſoule of Chriſt, neither is it in the eſſence of his diuine nature, but it is a conformitie in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine qualities and graces, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2. Pet. 1.4. <hi>We are partakers of the godly nature in flying the corruption which is in the world by luſt.</hi> This conformitie to Chriſt, is partly in this life, and partly in the life to come. In this life it is a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the holy actions, and to the holy ſufferings of Chriſt, a liuing after the example of Chriſt, and a ſuffering with Chriſt after the ſimilitude of Chriſt, which the Apoſtle cals, <hi>A par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of Chriſts ſufferings,</hi> 1. Pet. 4.13. In the life to come it is a likeneſſe and conformitie to Chriſt in the perfection of glorie, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. Cor. 15.49. <hi>We ſhall beare the image of the heauenly.</hi> And 1. Ioh. 3.2. <hi>When he ſhall appeare we ſhall be like him:</hi> the meaning is in glorie. <hi>That he might be the first borne among many brethren.</hi> In theſe words the Apoſtle ſpeakes by way of ſimilitude and alluſion, and he alludes to the firſt borne, ſpoken of in the old Teſtament. As the firſt borne in the old Teſtament did excell, and did beare both the chiefe burthen in the familie, and had alſo the chiefe honour in the familie, as might be ſhewed: ſo Chriſt hath prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and preheminence among his brethren, both in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in ſuffering, and alſo in glorie. And ſo the meaning of the Apoſtle is this: that he might be the firſt borne, and haue preferment, and preheminence among his brethren, both in holineſſe, in ſuffering, and alſo in glorie. <hi>Among many brethren:</hi>
                  <pb n="658" facs="tcp:492:334"/> that is, among the ſonnes of God by adoption and grace, who in that regard are the brethren of Chriſt, and are here ſaid to be many, as they are conſidered by themſelues. Now then thus conceiue we the meaning of the words of this verſe, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For thoſe which the Lord did fore-acknowledge and embrace in his eternall loue as his owne, and of his free loue did ſet apart to life and ſaluation before the foundation of the world, them did he alſo fore-ordaine, and aforehand decree and fore-appoint to be made like and conformable to Chriſt his Sonne, partly in this life, both in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actions and alſo in holy ſufferings, both in liuing after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt, and alſo in ſuffering after the ſimilitude of Chriſt, and al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o in the life to come in eternall glorie; yet ſo, as that Chriſt his Sonne might be the first borne, and might haue preferment and preheminence both in holineſſe and ſuffering, and alſo in glorie among thoſe that are the ſonnes of God by adoption, who in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard are his brethren, and are many being conſidered by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now firſt the Apoſtle here ſpeakes of Gods foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that is, of his fore-knowledging of ſome, and his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of them in his eternall loue as his owne before the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world, he giues vs to vnderſtand thus much.</p>

Whence we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus with our ſelues: If brotherly loue be a leſſon taught
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:492:347"/> by the Spirit of God, who then is the teacher of deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred? who puts into any man or woman ſwelling and heart-burning againſt their brerhren? are theſe leſſons taught of Gods Spirit? No, no, he is the God of peace and loue, and theſe are the teachings of another ſpirit, euen of that ſpirit who is the author of confuſion, and ſower of diſſention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong brethren: theſe are the teachings of the diuell himſelfe, and take we heed of them, yea take thou heed whoſoeuer thou art, that thy heart be not eſtranged and drawne away in the affections of it from others in whom thou maiſt diſcerne the image of God, and the true feare of God, becauſe they differ from thee in iudgement and opinion touching matters of circumſtance and Church-gouemment; and let not thine heart vent out the malice of it in bitter words againſt ſuch perſons. How dareſt thou profeſſing the true feare of God, preferre a Preacher that in his teaching derogates from the infinite merit of Chriſt his death, his ſuffering being of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite merit, becauſe the perſon that ſuffered was both God and man, when it is ſaid that <hi>the Church was purchaſed with the bloud of God,</hi> Acts 20.28? how dareſt thou preferre ſuch a Preacher before one who is ſound and faithfull in his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, becauſe haply he tels thee, and offers to make it good, that in the foure Euangeliſts there is not a word of Church-gouernment? Surely thy hard cenſuring of ſuch a man is either out of thy weakeneſſe of iudgement, or out of the malice of thine heart, or from both; and it is thy ſinne, and take thou notice of it, and learne to be reformed, and labour thou to be knit to all that truly feare God, and beare the image of God in a meaſure of true holineſſe, in the true loue and affection of thine heart, though they differ from thee in iudgement in matters circumſtantiall.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shewed you when I entred on verſe 29. that in that and this 30. verſe our Apoſtle proues, that all things, euen afflictions worke for the beſt to thoſe that are called according to Gods eternall purpoſe, and that by two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. The firſt layd downe verſe 29. which we haue alreadie handled. Now his ſecond argument prouing that concluſion, is in this 30. verſe: and it is taken from the infallible certaintie of that order which the Lord holdeth in bringing his choſen to life and glorie in heauen: euen from the firſt ground and beginning, and the firſt cauſe of it, to the thing it ſelfe, their full and perfect glorification in heauen. And the argument ſtands thus.</p>
               <p>That the Lord hauing of his free loue from euerlaſting, and before the world was, fore-appointed, and fore-ordained his choſen to life and glorie in heauen, he certainly proceeds, and he goeth on in his manifeſtation of that his loue, and in the accompliſhment of his owne eternall purpoſe, in that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he hath appointed, by adding one degree of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his loue and of the accompliſhment of his owne purpoſe to another: and to his preordination and fore-appointing his choſen to life and glorie, he adds in time their vocation, and to their vocation their iuſtification, and to their iuſtification the full accompliſhment of his loue to them, namely, their full and perfect glorification in heauen. And therfore it muſt needs be that all things worke together
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:492:349"/> for the beſt vnto them that are called according to Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now in this verſe, for the generall matter of it, the Apoſtle layes downe foure effects by which God doth witneſſe his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall loue to his choſen, which are ſet downe as foure ſteps or degrees by which Gods choſen aſcend and climbe vp to their bleſſedneſſe in heauen, and thoſe foure degrees are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably linked and tyed one to another, as ſo many linkes of a golden chaine, and they cannot be broke off or ſeuered one from another. As that God doth predeſtinate ſome to life and glorie; and whom he hath predeſtinate, them he certainly cals; and whom he cals, them he iuſtifies; and whom he iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, them he alſo glorifies. <hi>Moreouer</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>whom he predeſtinate, them alſo he called: and whom he called, them alſo he iustified: and whom he iuſtified, them alſo he glorified.</hi> And of theſe foure degrees, the firſt is done from all eternitie and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all times, namely, predeſtination: and the other three they are effected in time.</p>
               <p>Come we now to ſearch out the meaning of the words.<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>Moreouer whom he predeſtinate.</hi> I ſhewed you in the verſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going what is the meaning of the word <hi>predeſtinate,</hi> namely, to appoint a thing to a certaine end aforehand, and it is here to be vnderſtood of Gods act of predeſtination touching his elect, and that is plaine from the context. In the verſe forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Whom he knew before, he predeſtinate them to be made like to the image of his Sonne:</hi> that is, in heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glorie: and here he ſaith, <hi>Whom he predeſtinate, them he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and iuſtified, and glorified.</hi> And therefore it muſt be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of predeſtination to life and glorie in heauen, and ſo the meaning of the Apoſtle is, whom the Lord before all times fore-appointed and fore-ordained to life and glorie in heauen, <hi>Them alſo he called.</hi> The word <hi>called</hi> was before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded verſe 28.<note place="margin">Verſe 28.</note> and I there ſhewed that ſome are called, and that by the voice of God in the miniſterie of his word, but they anſwer not the call of God: and of ſuch ſpeakes Chriſt, Matt. 20.16. <hi>Many are called but few are choſen.</hi> Others being called by the voice of God in the miniſterie of his
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:492:350"/> word, they anſwer the call of God, and they are effectually called <hi>out of darkneſſe into a maruellous light,</hi> as 1. Pet. 2.9. And in this ſence is the word here taken: and the Apoſtles mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, Them alſo doth the Lord in time effectually work on by his holy Spirit, and bring them by the worke of his good Spirit, through the preaching of his word, from ignorance and vnbeliefe to true knowledge and faith in Chriſt, and ſet them out of the ſtate of nature into the ſtate of grace. <hi>And whom he hath thus called, them alſo he iuſtified,</hi> The word <hi>iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> hath many acceptions, I will not trouble you with them, it is here to be taken as a terme fetcht from courts of iuſtice, and it is oppoſed to condemning: ſo the Apoſtle himſelfe makes oppoſition, verſe 33.34. <hi>It is God that iuſtifieth, who ſhall condemne?</hi> and ſo it ſignifieth to acquit and to abſolue in iudgement. When therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>them alſo he iuſtifieth,</hi> it is as if he had ſaid, them alſo he acquitteth and abſolueth both from the guilt and puniſhment of all their ſinnes, and accounteth them iuſt and righteous in his ſight by Chriſt his righteouſneſſe imputed to them, and apprehended by faith, as the Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 4.5.6. <hi>To him that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in him that iuſtifieth the vngodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſſe:</hi> as <hi>Dauid declareth the bleſſedneſſe of the man to whom God imputeth righteouſneſſe.</hi> And 2. Corinth. 5.21. the Apoſtle affirmes, that <hi>Chriſt was made ſinne for vs, who knew no ſinne, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him. And whom he iuſtifieth, them alſo he glorifieth.</hi> To glorifie is to make glorious, by putting away baſeneſſe and diſhonour, and by putting on of honour and glorie. Now the Lord doth make his choſen glorious, and put away their baſeneſſe, and put honour and glorie on them, partly in this life, by making them holy; for their holineſſe and ſanctification in this life is their glorification begun. And hence the Church is ſaid to be <hi>all glorious within,</hi> Pſal. 45.13. And holineſſe of life here in this world is termed glorie by the Apoſtle, 2. Cor. 3.18. <hi>We are changed into the ſame image from glorie to glorie.</hi> But the Lord doth make his choſen fully glorious in the life to come in heauen, by making them there perfectly holy, their glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:492:350"/> in heauen being their ſanctification conſummate and made perfect, and by putting on their bodies and on their ſoules immortalitie, and full happineſſe and glorie: both theſe are here to be vnderſtood vnder the word <hi>glorified. Them alſo he glorifieth:</hi> that is, them alſo doth the Lord make glorious, partly in this life, by making them holy, and by ſanctifying them in part, in their ſoules and bodies; and in the life to come in heauen fully glorious, by making them perfectly holy, and by putting on their bodies and ſoules immortalitie, eternall life, and full and perfect happineſſe and glorie. Now then thus conceiue we the meaning of the Apoſtle in this verſe, as if he had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moreouer, whom the Lord before all times fore-appointed and fore-ordained to life and glorie in heauen, they alſo are by him in time effectually called, they are effectually wrought on by his holy Spirit, and brought by the worke of his holy Spirit, through the preaching of the word, from ignorance and vnbeliefe, to true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and faith in Chriſt, and ſet out of the ſtate of ignorance and vnbeliefe into the ſtate of true knowledge and faith in Chriſt Ieſus: and they that are thus effectually called, they are alſo by him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted and abſolued from the guilt and puniſhment of all their ſins, and they are accounted iuſt and righteous in his ſight by Chriſt his righteouſneſſe imputed to them, and apprehended by faith: and they that are thus iuſtified, they are alſo by him made glorious, partly in this life, he here making them holy, and ſanctifying them in part, and in the life to come in heauen fully glorious, he there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them perfectly holy, and there putting on them, on their bodies and ſoules immortalitie, eternall life, and full and perfect happineſſe and glorie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in that the Apoſtle here and in the verſe foregoing ſpeakes of Gods predeſtination, of his fore-appointing ſome to life and glorie in heauen, I might ſtand to ſhew that the doctrine of Gods predeſtination is a doctrine that ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t to be publiſhed and made knowne to Gods people. Some are of opinion that it ought to be concealed and kept from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, but they are deceiued, it is a thing reuealed in the written word of God, and ſo it <hi>belongs to vs,</hi> Deut. 29.29. Oh
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:492:351"/> but ſome ſay, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                  </label> it is a doctrine that either workes deſpaire in men, or it makes them careleſſe of the meanes of ſaluation, and of good workes. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> It is not ſo, it is a ſpeciall ground of true comfort and ſound patience vnder the croſſe, and it doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily inferre the vſe of the meanes of ſaluation, becauſe whom God hath predeſtinate, them he doth in time conuert, and will by the vſe of the meanes: yea it makes men ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſeriouſly and chearfully to do good duties, and they neuer do good workes with ſuch alacritie as when they know and beleeue that God in his eternall loue towards them hath freely predeſtinated them to life and glorie. They then loue God, becauſe he hath from euerlaſting appointed them to life and ſaluation, 1. Ioh. 4.19. but I will not ſtand on that. One point I will touch in a word, we ſee the Apoſtle here makes not the act of Gods predeſtination to life and glorie in heauen vniuerſall, and reaching to all men and women in the world; but he bounds and limits it to ſome, namely, to ſuch as in time are effectually called and iuſtified, and ſhall in time be alſo glorified, he links theſe together inſeparably. Whence the point is this.</p>

Act. 13.48. it is ſaid, <hi>As many as were ordained to eternall life belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:</hi> thereby implying, that ſome were ordained to eternall life, and ſome were not. Rom. 9.22.23. the Apoſtle makes knowne that ſome were <hi>veſſels of Gods mercie prepared to glorie, and others were veſſels of Gods wrath prepared to deſtruction.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. 1.4.5. the Apoſtle doth appropriate Gods eternall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and predeſtination to life and glorie onely to himſelfe, and to other true beleeuers, and ſaith, <hi>God hath choſen vs in Chriſt before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in loue: And hath predeſtinate vs, to be adopted through Ieſus Chriſt vnto himſelfe according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> And the reaſon of this, that Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:492:351"/> to life and glorie is not vniuerſall and reaching to all, is this.</p>
               <p>The Lord is both infinitely mercifull and alſo infinitely iuſt, and he will be knowne ſo to be: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> he will haue both his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercie and alſo his infinite iuſtice manifeſted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to his glorie, and by both, and that in reſpect of man, which could not haue bene if all and euerie man in the world had bene fore-appointed to life and glory in heauen; for then all muſt needs haue bene ſaued, and then the Lord had made himſelfe knowne to be a God of infinite mercie onely, and not of infinite iuſtice in reſpect of men. And therefore doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it is a certaine truth, that Gods predeſtination to life and glorie in heauen is not vniuerſall, it reacheth not to all and euery man and woman in the world. And for vſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this truth ſerues to diſcouer the errour of that opinion <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> held by ſome,<note place="margin">Vniuerſall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt held by ſome, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> that the worke of redemption wrought by Chriſt is vniuerſall, that Chriſt died for all generally without exception of any, and that <hi>quoad efficatiam realem,</hi> and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>quoad ſufficientiam praetij:</hi> and that ſome notwithſtanding are not ſaued, they ſay it is through their owne default, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not.

Beſides this, it cannot ſtand with the truth now deliuered; for if predeſtination to life and glorie be not vniuerſall, if it reach not to euery man and woman in the world, then certainly Chriſt died not for all and euerie one, his death was not really effectuall for all and euerie one. For the Scripture is plaine that Chriſt died onely for Gods elect, and that he is <hi>the Sauiour of his Church and of his bodie,</hi> Ephe. 5.23. and that he onely <hi>redeemed his Church by his bloud,</hi> Act. 20.28.

And therefore vniuerſall redemption wrought by Chriſt, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reall efficacie of it, is but a deuice of mans braine, and we ſhall find it to be but a deceiuing ground of comfort, if we reſt on this, that Chriſt died for all: and if thou haſt no better ground of comfort in the time of need, (as indeed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie haue not) thou ſhalt finde it will deceiue thee, and when thy conſcience ſhall be awakened and diſtreſſed, it will then be readie to exempt thee from the benefit of redemption, and will then tell thee, Chriſt indeed died for all, if all would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him, but thou by thy ſinnes haſt cut thy ſelfe off from him, and therefore the benefit of his death belongs not to thee, and it will do thee no good. Learne therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it as erronious and falſe, and a deceiuing ground of comfort, that Chriſt died for all, and that the reall efficacie of his death belongs to all.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> For a ſecond vſe: is it ſo that the act of Gods predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to life and glorie is not vniuerſall?<note place="margin">The Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts confuted in that they hold vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall election on condition of faith, and of obedience to the Goſpel.</note> Did not God from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting fore-appoint euerie man and woman in the world to life and ſaluation? Surely then the Anabaptiſts are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and it muſt needs be erronious and falſe which they hold and teach; that God did chuſe all men both good and bad to the kingdome of heauen, on condition of faith and of obedience to the Goſpell, for that is their poſition, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by their owne words in a Pamphlet lately put forth by them. And to this purpoſe (forſooth) they make Gods ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction twofold, eternall and before the creation of the world, and actuall and in time: and they ſay, Gods eternall election is Gods eternall purpoſe and decree to elect ſuch perſons to life and ſaluation in whom he findeth faith and obedience; and thoſe perſons he electeth to ſaluation for the qualitie he finds in them. And ſo they ſay, Gods eternall election is not of the particular perſon, but of the qualitie; and Gods actuall
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:492:352"/> election they ſay is his electing of thoſe in time who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and taught by the Goſpell preached, and do beleeue it and yeeld obedience to it, and ſo are actually choſen for their faith and for their obedience. And thus they make Gods eternall election to be a purpoſe in God before the creation of the world, to ſaue all generally without exception of any, and a fore-ordaining of all to life and ſaluation, as well vnbeleeuers as beleeuers, on the condition of faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, if they would beleeue and obey the Goſpell; and his actuall election to be an electing and chooſing of ſome to life and glorie now beleeuing the Goſpell, and now yeelding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to it. A meere idle and fooliſh diſtinction, yea ſuch as hath no ground or footing in the word of God. Where do they finde in all the booke of God ſuch a diſtinction, let them ſhew it if they can? In what Goſpell is it written, Beleeue and obey the Goſpell and thou ſhalt be actually elected? Indeed we find it written in the Goſpell, Beleeue and obey the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and thou ſhalt be ſaued. Beleeuing and obeying the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is a neceſſarie antecedent to life and ſaluation, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required before ſaluation, but neuer do we find it to be an antecedent, going before Gods election to life and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in heauen, and as a thing required to Gods election to life and ſaluation. God indeed decreed with himſelfe to ſaue through Chriſt all them that do beleeue, but their beleeuing is not before Gods actuall chuſing of them to life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, that we find not in any place of Scripture, but it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily goes before their ſaluation. Ioh. 10.27.<note place="margin">Ioh. 10 27.</note> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>My ſheepe heare my voice, or beleeue in me, becauſe I know them.</hi> But they ſay, We are ſheepe, or elect ordained to life and glorie becauſe we beleeue.</p>
               <p>Againe, when as they ſay, Gods eternall election is not of the particular perſon but of the qualitie, they ſpeake abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Did God chuſe faith and obedience to ſaluation? Did he chuſe theſe qualities to go to heauen, and not the perſon in whom theſe qualities of faith and obedience are found? But to take them in the beſt ſence, and their meaning to be this; In regard they expound it, that God did purpoſe and decree
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:492:353"/> before the creation to elect to ſaluation ſuch perſons in whom he ſhould find faith and obedience, this being their meaning their poſition doth exceedingly derogate from the all-ſufficiencie of God, as if the Lord muſt be beholding to ſomething in vs before his will could be determined; and as if his will muſt depend on ſomething out of himſelfe in man, on which it may be determined to elect; yea it makes God to be in ſuſpence touching that wherein afterwards on ſome ſight he comes to be fully determined: as if the Lord who is infinite in wiſedome, in will, and power, ſhould thus demurre with himſelfe, I purpoſe if hereafter I ſhall finde in men faith and obedience to the Goſpell, to chuſe them to life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, otherwiſe not. Oh what a monſtrous derogation is this from the Lords all-ſufficiencie! and how doth this dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the abſolute will of God, and from the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, which is the ſupreame cauſe of Gods predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to life and ſaluation, as Epheſ. 1.5. Now for the places of Scripture they bring to proue that God did purpoſe and decree before the creation of the world to ſaue all perſons in whom he ſhould find faith and obedience, they are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the anſwering, they do fearefully abuſe and peruert the Scripture, they bring that, Act. 17.28. where it is ſaid, <hi>We are Gods generation,</hi> and they reaſon thus, All perſons are Gods generation, therefore Gods eternall election is not of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon but of the qualitie. What an abſurd kinde of reaſoning is this? doth it follow becauſe all perſons are Gods generation, and haue their being in him, therefore Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall election is not of particular perſon, but of qualitie, or of perſons thus and thus qualified? theſe things follow not one another. And for the places they bring to proue that God doth actually elect ſome to life and ſaluation now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing the Goſpell, and now yeelding obedience to it, they are moſt impertinent, they proue no ſuch matter: they bring Rom. 9.25. Epheſ. 1.13.14. 1. Pet. 2.10. in all which places, if ye looke into them, you ſhall finde there is not a word tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Gods election, they imply no ſuch thing, but they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther import effectuall vocation and calling, or dwelling of

The way to find our ſelues in the number of Gods choſen, and to be ſuch as haue bene predeſtinate to life and ſaluation before the world was, is not to ſtep vp into heauen and to ſearch the Court roles of heauen whether our names be there written, but to looke into our owne hearts and ſoules, and there to finde the worke of grace written and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed by the finger of Gods Spirit. And if thou whoſoeuer thou art, find that worke of grace in thee, if thou find thy ſelfe effectually called, ſurely then thou haſt cauſe to reioyce with <hi>ioy vnſpeakeable and glorious,</hi> 1. Pet. 1.8. thou haſt then a ſure and a ſweete teſtimonie of Gods eternall loue to thee, and thy ſaluation is built on a ſtronger foundation then the very heauens, euen on Gods eternall and vnchangeable purpoſe, and thou maiſt know that thou art effectually called and wrought on by the word and Spirit of God. I haue hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore giuen notes by which a man may know that he is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called, as if he find himſelfe enlightened, and that he now ſees his wretched eſtate by nature, and his curſed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſinne, and is able to apply the promiſes of life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to himſelfe particularly, and that he hath now in him
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:492:360"/> an hatred and loathing of thoſe ſinnes that haue bene former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moſt pleaſing to him; and that now he is fitted for the high calling of a Chriſtian, with graces needfull for the exerciſe of pietie and religion towards God, and of loue, and mercie, and equitie, and iuſtice towards men, and is able to ſhew forth the power of grace in his life and conuerſation, and doth now make choice of holy and religious companie, and doth now delight in the meanes by which he hath bene wrought on, as in hearing the word, euen the Law diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſinne to him, and laying open his hidden corruptions, and eſpecially in hearing the ſweete promiſes of the Goſpell touching life and ſaluation, and that now he doth thoſe things that fleſh and blould would neuer teach him to do; as that he hath a care of religion and of heauenly things in proſperitie, and the more the Lord doth proſper him in outward things, the more holy he is: and that in time of aduerſitie he drawes nearer to God, and holds cloſe to the profeſſion of religion, and is conſtant in a diſgraced profeſſion, and that now he makes more precious account of his high calling in Ieſus Chriſt then of all the honours and preferments in the world. If a man find theſe things in himſelfe, he may aſſure himſelfe that he is effectually called. And howſoeuer the Papiſts ſay to the contrarie, that a man cannot certainly know whether he haue the Spirit of God working in him or no, yet doubtleſſe he may plainly and ſenſibly perceiue the working of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in his owne ſoule. <hi>The Spirit is compared to fire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>and to the wind, and as ſenſible as a man may perceiue the burning of the fire, and the blowing of the wind, ſo ſenſibly may a child of God perceiue in himſelfe the worke of the Spirit of God.</hi> If thou finde that worke in thine owne ſoule, thou maieſt thereby aſſure thy ſelfe that thou art in the number of Gods choſen, and ſo haue ſtrong conſolation.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the third effect by which God doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe his eternall loue to his choſen, and the third degree by which Gods choſen aſcend vp to their bleſſedneſſe in heauen, here put downe by the Apoſtle, namely, their iuſtification. <hi>Whom he predeſtinate</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>them alſo he called: and
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:492:361"/> whom he called, them alſo he iuſtified:</hi> that is, as I ſhewed, they that are effectually called of God, they are alſo by him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted and abſolued from the guilt and puniſhment of all their ſins, and they are accounted iuſt &amp; righteous in his ſight by Chriſt his righteouſneſſe imputed to them, and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by faith. Now here we ſee that effectuall calling and iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication are diſtinct benefits, and they are here made ſeuerall and diſtinct effects of Gods loue to his choſen, and they are not to be confounded and made one, as they are by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Papiſts: for according to the doctrine of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, they teaching a double iuſtification in the ſight of God, their firſt iuſtification is nothing elſe but the calling of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; in effect they make their firſt iuſtification and calling of a ſinner all one, they teaching that their firſt iuſtification is, when a ſinner of an euill man is made a good man by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of inward righteouſneſſe, whereby the heart is purged and ſanctified, and ſo indeed all one with the calling of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner out of the ſtate of nature into the ſtate of grace; and ſo they confound things that are to be diſtinguiſhed one from another. I leaue that.</p>
               <p>Now though effectuall calling and iuſtification be diſtinct benefits, yet they follow one another immediatly, and we ſee they are here linked one to the other inſeparably; whom the Lord cals, them alſo he iuſtifies: whence we are giuen to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thus much.</p>

Acts 26.18. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, he was ſent to the Gentiles, <hi>To open their eyes that they might turne from darkeneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan vnto God,</hi> that by his preaching the Goſpell to them, they might be effectually called, and wrought on, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, and then he preſently ſubioynes, <hi>That they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue forgiueneſſe of ſins,</hi> that they might be iuſtified, remiſſion of ſinnes being one part of iuſtification; plainly teaching, that effectuall calling and iuſtification in the ſight of God, they go together. And to this purpoſe ſpeakes the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 13.39. <hi>By him</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that is by Chriſt, euery one that beleeueth is iuſtified.</hi> Euery one that is brought out of the ſtate of vnbeleefe into the ſtate of true faith in Chriſt, he is at that very inſtant iuſtified.

               <p>Come we now to the fourth and laſt effect by which God doth witneſſe his eternall loue to his choſen, and the fourth degree by which Gods choſen aſcend vp to their bleſſedneſſe in heauen, namely, their glorification. <hi>Whom he predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, them alſo he called:</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and whom he called, them alſo he iustified: and whom he iuſtified, them alſo he glorified.</hi> That is, as I made knowne, they that are iuſtified in the ſight of God, and whom the Lord doth acquit from the guilt and puniſhment of their ſinnes by the merit of Chriſt his death, and account iuſt and righteous in his ſight by Chriſt his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe imputed, they are alſo by him made glorious, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this life, he here making them holy, &amp; ſanctifying them in part, and in the life to come in heauen fully glorious, he here making them perfectly holy, and there putting on them on their bodies and ſoules immortality, eternall life, and full and perfect happineſſe and glorie.

Corinth. 6.11. the Apoſtle ſaith of the beleeuing Corinthians, that whereas they had bene filthy, and guilty of many ſoule ſinnes there reckened vp, <hi>Yet now they were waſhed</hi> from the guilt of thoſe ſinnes in the bloud of Chriſt, and <hi>now they were ſanctified and iuſtified.</hi> He affirmes that theſe two, iuſtification and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification met together in them, they were now iuſtified in the name of the Lord Ieſus, and now alſo ſanctified by the Spirit of God. 2.

And Iude verſe 1. we find that theſe two, <hi>called and ſanctified of God,</hi> are there ioyned together, and ſuch as are effectually called (as ye haue heard) they are alſo iuſtified in the ſight of God. And ſo it muſt needs be a truth, that ſanctification euer followes on iuſtification, and ſuch as are iuſtified in the ſight of God in and through Chriſt, they are alſo ſanctified by the grace of his Spirit. For why, the reaſons and grounds of this truth are theſe.</p>

               <p>That the holineſſe and ſanctification of Gods children is a <label type="milestone">

Pet. 4.14. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Spirit of glorie resteth on Gods children:</hi> how then can it be but that they are moſt glorious? And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaking of them, Iſai. 4.5. he ſaith, <hi>That on all the glorie there ſhall be a defence.</hi> And the Lord himſelfe ſpeakes thus of his people, Iſai. 43.4. <hi>Thou waſt glorious in my ſight and honourable.</hi> And hence it is that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1. Pet. 3.4. <hi>The hid man of the heart,</hi> that is, inward holineſſe and ſanctification is a thing much ſet by before God; that is the thing that makes Gods children glorious, and that is part of the glorie of God beſtowed on them, and that makes them exceeding graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and pleaſing in his ſight: and it muſt needs be ſo, for why.</p>
               <p>True holineſſe and ſanctification is the expreſſe image of God in the ſoules of men, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> and therein they are like to God himſelfe, euen the God of glorie: and the more holy they are, the more are they like to God, who is infinitly glorious. And therefore doubtleſſe holineſſe and ſanctification in Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is a moſt glorious thing, and it is part of the glorie that God beſtowes on his choſen.</p>
               <p>What fooles then are wicked and graceleſſe perſons, who <label type="milestone">

<pb n="722" facs="tcp:492:366"/> on Gods children as a matter of diſgrace, which indeed is their glorie, and ſo they diſcouer their owne ſhame and follie. Well, thou that art a child of God, care not for their mocks, but be thou ſtirred vp to a ſpeciall care of holineſſe and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, euen to haue thy ſoule inueſted with it as with a goodly glorious garment; that is part of thy glorie begun here to be made perfect in heauen, and that indeed will make thee glorious within and without; that is the <hi>clothing of broi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered gold,</hi> ſpoken of Pſal. 45.13. and that will make thee glorious in the ſight of God, and of his holy Angels, and of all good men. Many in the world ſpend much time, and take great paines in trimming vp their bodies, yea ſome are afraid of nothing more then of true holineſſe and ſanctification: for indeed if proud perſons, and the nice dames of our age had true holineſſe in them, they durſt not do as they do, if they had ſanctifying grace in their hearts, without queſtion it would croſſe their pride, and it would not ſuffer them to make idols of their bodies, and to beſtow ſo much time as commonly they do in tricking and trimming vp their bodies in vaine and new ſangled attire, which indeed makes them odious and vgly in the ſight of God and of all good men; yea many times by the iuſt hand of God, in the ſight of men and women like to themſelues, and men and women like to themſelues ſcorne and contemne them, yea point at them, and ſay, there goes a proud foole. Oh therefore labour thou whoſoeuer thou art that doſt profeſſe the feare of God, labour thou for holineſſe and ſanctification, to adorne thy ſoule with that, and to decke thy ſoule with the ſanctifying grace of Gods Spirit; thereby through Chriſt thou ſhalt appeare glorious and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the ſight of the higheſt maieſtie, whom thou ſhouldeſt ſeeke to pleaſe aboue all the world: yea ſeeke thou to pleaſe him both in heart and life, and to be gracious in his ſight, though thou croſſe thine owne humour neuer ſo much, and diſcontent the beſt friends thou haſt in the world.</p>
               <p>Now from hence, that the word <hi>glorified</hi> here compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends vnder it, both ſanctification here in this world, and full and perfect happineſſe and glorie in heauen; and in that

               <p>Now the Apoſtle in ſetting downe this magnificent and glorious triumph of a true beleeuer and of a iuſtified perſon, oppoſeth to all temptations and aſſaults that might diſquiet him, and trouble him, contrarie cauſes of comfort, remouing euerie aſſault with a contrarie cauſe and ground of comfort; and this he doth firſt generally verſe 31. and then more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the verſes following: we will lay them forth as we ſhall come to them.</p>

And his meaning in theſe words, <hi>What ſhall we ſay,</hi> is, what comfort may we gather from theſe things? let vs not paſſe them by, or let them ſlip without meditation and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the comfort is exceeding great: what admirable ſweetneſſe, and what heauenly comfort may we ſucke out of theſe things, if they be duly thought on and ſoundly applyed? <hi>If God be on our ſide, or for vs.</hi> The word <hi>If,</hi> is not here vſed doubtfully, but affirmatiuely, and the meaning is, God being on our ſide, or for vs. Now God is ſaid to be on our ſide, or with vs, either by his generall power vpholding vs, as he <hi>doth vphold and ſuſtaine all things in their being by his mighty word,</hi> Hebr. 1.3. or by his ſpeciall care and prouidence, as a louing and gracious father and protector.

Though the Lord be with all men and women in the world, ſuſtaining them in their being, otherwiſe they cannot continue one minute of an houre, and in him they <hi>liue, moue, and haue their being,</hi> Act. 17.28. yet he is not with all after a ſpeciall manner, but onely with his elect, being now effectually called, and iuſtified in his ſight; with them, and with them onely is the Lord as a gracious and louing father, and as a powerfull protector, watching ouer them by his ſpeciall care and prouidence.

To which ſimilitude Chriſt alludes, Matth. 23.37. <hi>How often would I haue gathered thy children together, as the hen gathereth her chickens vnder her wings?</hi> and he is to them as a ſhield, as a buckler.

Alas, thouſands in the world thinke that God is with them, and God keepes them by his ſpeciall prouidence, and yet they haue no other ground for it but a vaine preſumption, and blind hope of their owne.

And do not many iudge of Gods preſence with them by their thriuing in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things?

               <p>Now a ſecond thing offered from theſe words, <hi>If God be on our ſide, or for vs, or with vs, who can be againſt vs?</hi> being vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as they haue bene expounded, is this.</p>
               <p>That ſuch as haue God on their ſide, for them, or with <label type="milestone">

So then this is implyed, &amp; it ariſeth from hence naturally,</p>
               <p>That Gods children, iuſtified perſons, or members of Chriſt, who haue God on their ſide, or for them, or with them, they meete with oppoſition, they haue ſome who oppoſe them, and ſet themſelues againſt them, yea many riſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as <hi>Dauid</hi> complained, when he fled from <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi> as Pſal. 31. The diuell, the world, perſecuting tyrants, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, heretickes, and ſuch like, theſe ſet themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; and this Chriſt hath foretold, Ioh. 16.33. <hi>In the world</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye ſhall haue affliction and trouble, but be of good cheare, I haue ouercome the world:</hi> in the world ye ſhall be ſure to meete with many rubs, and much oppoſition. Yea he hath foretold, Luke 12.52.53. that there ſhall be fiue dwelling
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:492:374"/> together in one houſe, diuided and ſet againſt one another, <hi>The father againſt the ſonne, and the ſonne against the father; the mother againſt the daughter, and the daughter againſt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And Math. 10.36. that <hi>a mans enemies ſhall be they of his owne houſhold:</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> complained out of his owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, Pſal. 41.9. <hi>My familiar friend</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whom I tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, which did eate my bread, hath lift vp the heele againſt me,</hi> hath ſpurned at me, &amp; ſet himſelfe againſt me. And this truth might be further exemplified from the beginning ſince the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> to this very day, and daily experience ſhewes it ſo to be: we ſee it, or we may ſee it, that the children of God, who haue God on their ſide, or for them, or with them, they are oppoſed and ſet againſt, not onely by the diuell, and the world, and by enemies abroad, but many times by their owne kindred and neareſt friends: the father ſets himſelfe againſt the ſonne becauſe he is religious, the ſonne againſt the father, and the mother againſt the daughter, and the daughter againſt the mother: and the reaſons of it are theſe.</p>

               <p>And therefore it is no wonder that Gods children, iuſtified perſons, and members of Chriſt, who haue God on their ſide, for them, or with them, do meete with oppoſition, and that they haue the diuell, the world, and many enemies oppoſing them, and ſetting themſelues againſt them.

Pet. 4.12. it hath bene ſo, and it will be ſo to the end. The world
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:492:374"/> commonly thinks Gods children turbulent and troubleſome perſons, buſie-bodies, and that the courſe of their life is not good. Why ſo? For ſooth becauſe many ſpeake againſt them, and many ſet themſelues againſt them. Oh ſay men, theſe Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes, who are accounted the children of God, are ſurely vile and bad perſons, ſo many mouthes are opened againſt them, and ſo many ſet themſelues againſt them: would men ſet themſelues againſt them, if there were not iuſt cauſe? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, 1.

It is no new thing that ſo they do, and we may not ſo conclude, that Gods children are vile and bad perſons, and that the courſe of their life is not good, becauſe they are oppoſed and much ſet againſt in the world: that is no good concluſion, that is but the concluſion of the blind multitude; and yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a child of God is readie thus to conclude againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to thinke, Surely I am not in the right way, and the courſe of my life is not good and pleaſing to God, and to ſay as <hi>Gedeon</hi> did, Iudg. 6.13. <hi>If the Lord were with me, why am I then thus troubled,</hi> and thus oppoſed and ſet againſt? I find ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors within, and fightings without, and I am on euery ſide hardly dealt withall, and ill intreated, and therefore I doubt of my ſtanding, and that the courſe of my life is not good and pleaſing to God. Now this is no good concluſion, Satan thruſteth it on thee whoſoeuer thou art, taking aduantage of thy weakneſſe. The heathen man could ſay, <hi>Laudari à non laudato eſt illaudari,</hi> to be praiſed of a wicked man is rather diſpraiſe then commendation. And ſo to be ill ſpoken of and ſet againſt by wicked men, no occaſion being giuen them, is no diſparagement, it may rather be an argument of comfort, and may perſwade thee that thou art in the right way, and in a good courſe, becauſe the diuell; and the inſtruments of the
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:492:375"/> diuell, the wicked of the world, heretickes, and Atheiſts, and ſuch like, ſpeake euill of thee, and ſet themſelues againſt thee. The diuell were not like himſelfe, nor the world like it ſelfe, if they did not ſet themſelues againſt Gods children. Ioh. 15.19. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If ye were of the world, the world would loue you, but becauſe ye are not of the world, but I haue choſen you out of the world:</hi> becauſe I haue called you out of the corrupt ſtate of the world, and you now differ from the world in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of your hearts, and in the courſe of your liues, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world hates you,</hi> and cannot but oppoſe againſt you. Thus it hath bene, thus it is, and thus it will be to the end of the world: and therefore thinke it not ſtrange, thou being a child of God, that thou meeteſt with oppoſition, and that the wicked of the world ſet againſt thee: the more holy thou art, the more will the diuell rage againſt thee, and the more will the wicked of the world oppoſe againſt thee, and be not thereupon diſcouraged, but draw nearer to God, and go on chearefully and comfortably.</p>

The truth of this point then appeares, that though the diuell, the world, and many enemies, do oppoſe and ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt Gods children, iuſtified perſons, who haue God on their ſides, for them or with them after a ſpeciall manner, yet can they not hurt them, they cannot preuaile in that euill they intend againſt them, nor ſo much as touch on haire of their heads, further then the Lord is pleaſed to ſuffer them: for why.</p>

And for the vſe of this.</p>
               <p>Firſt on this ground of truth it followes, that the diuell and <label type="milestone">

We know that now the enemies of the Church and people of God and of the Goſpell, they band themſelues together, and they make themſelues ſtrong, and they plot &amp; deuiſe all the miſchiefe they can againſt ſuch as profeſſe the truth of religion, yea they imagine that they ſhall effect their purpoſe, &amp; they beare themſelues high on it. Well, the Lord is the ſame ſtrong and powerfull God that he hath bene, and he is able to diſappoint them, &amp; euen ſuddenly to ouerturne their counſels, and to bring to nought their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked plots and deuices, we haue had experience of it. How ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly did the Lord ouerturne the wicked purpoſe of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed leaguers, Anno 1588. when that inuincible nauie, as they made account, came againſt this land, and they made no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but that they ſhould certainly ouercome it? And how did the Lord wonderfully defeate that gunpowder plot, and bring confuſion on the heads of the plotters of it? The Lord is ſtill the ſame ſtrong God, and he is now as able to bring to

Indeed I grant they may be as rods in the hand of God for the correction and triall of his children, and the Lord may ſuffer them to go farre for our ſinnes: but aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly his children ſhall neuer be giuen ouer, to be vſed or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abuſed and wronged of them at their pleaſure and as they liſt. No, no, the Lord ſtands for the defence of his children, and will neuer ſuffer their enemies to preuaile againſt them to their hurt. <hi>The counſell of the Lord ſhall ſtand for euer,</hi> Pſal. 33.11. and there is no counſell, policie, or ſtrength, that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt his purpoſe. The enemies of the Goſpell do but what the Lord hath appointed, and what he will ſuffer them, and no more can they do though they burſt themſelues, and when they haue done the Lords worke he will eaſe his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of them, and take them as rods and throw them into the fire. And though, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Verſe our Apoſtle oppoſeth to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular aſſault and temptation that might haply trouble &amp; diſquiet the true beleeuing Romans and other true beleeuers, a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ground of comfort: and he here preuents an obiection that might be made by them, namely this: They might ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> you tell vs that God being on our ſide, for vs, or with vs, after a ſpeciall manner, as a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, kind, and gracious father, and powerfull protector, none can be againſt vs, none can preuaile againſt vs to our hurt: but in the meane while we muſt tell you, that we are preſſed with want, and penurie, and extreame pouertie, and lacke, and want of things needfull. Now this the Apoſtle meets withall, and in the words of this verſe he makes knowne to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing Romans and to other true beleeuers, that God will certainly and that freely giue them all things needfull, and they need not to be diſtracted and troubled with diffidence and doubting, in reſpect of any good thing needfull for them, but to reſt on it, and to be fully perſwaded of it, that God will ſupply all their wants, and not ſuffer them to want any need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full good thing. And this ground of comfort the Apoſtle here puts downe, not nakedly and barely, but in the proofe of it, and he proues it by an argument from the greater to the leſſe, that God hauing giuen to his children, to true beleeuers, the greater, he will not denie them the leſſe, but will certainly giue it to them; he hauing giuen them Chriſt who is the greateſt good thing, and more worth then a thouſand worlds, he will not ſuffer them to want other good things needfull, that is the Apoſtles argument, and that is amplified.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By a deſcription of Chriſt, that he is Gods owne Sonne, <hi>Who ſpared not his owne Sonne.</hi> And</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="741" facs="tcp:492:379"/>2. By an oppoſition of actions, that God ſpared not, but gaue vp or deliuered that Sonne of his.</p>
               <p>Together with the perſons for whom, namely, for vs all: <hi>Who ſpared not his Sonne, but gaue him for vs all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then followes the Apoſtles inference which he infers on that, that God ſpared not, but gaue him for vs all. That therefore he will denie vs no good thing needfull, but toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Sonne he will giue vs all needfull good things: which the Apoſtle deliuers more emphetically by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation: <hi>How ſhall he not with him giue vs all things alſo?</hi> So then in this verſe we haue two things in generall layed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt this propoſition, that God hath not ſpared his own Sonne, but hath giuen him for all true beleeuers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An inference following neceſſarily on this, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God will not denie true beleeuers any good thing.</p>
               <p>Let vs now examine the words of this verſe touching the ſence and meaning of them. <hi>Who ſpared not his owne Sonne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>or he that ſpared not:</hi> that is, <hi>God,</hi> ſpoken of verſe before. And thoſe words <hi>ſpared not,</hi> are very weightie, they ſignifie more then if it had bene ſaid, he gaue, though freely, and without any deſert at all: for one may giue and that freely, out of his owne abundance, but vnder thoſe words <hi>ſpared not,</hi> is implied the raritie and excellencie of the thing giuen, and the great worth of the gift, as a man is ſaid to ſpare no coſt when he layes it on and beſtowes the deareſt thing he hath; as if it had bene ſaid, God who hath not with held or kept backe that gift of the greateſt price and worth, euen that moſt rich and precious gift, <hi>His owne Sonne:</hi> that is, his eternall Sonne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of him from all eternitie, and of the ſame eternall eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with God the Father, and ſo <hi>his onely begotten Sonne,</hi> as he is called, Ioh. 3.16. his owne deare Sonne, <hi>But gaue him, or deliuered him</hi> vp. The meaning is, God gaue his Sonne to death, (for that being not in the text originall, may well be ſupplyed) as the principall cauſe. <hi>Iudas</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>traditor, or to deliuer him vp,</hi> Matth. 26.15. as the cauſe inſtrumentall, but God deliuered him vp as the principall cauſe, ordering
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:492:380"/> and gouerning the tradition of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and his deliuering him vp, as we haue it, Act. 2.23. <hi>He was taken by the hands of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, being deliuered by the determinate counſell and foreknowledge of God, and ſo crucified and ſlaine for vs all:</hi> that is, for me and you, and all true beleeuers. As if he had ſaid, Not onely for me and for other Apoſtles, and for you and others that are more eminent in grace, but for all that do or ſhall beleeue in Chriſt, according to that of Chriſt his prayer, Ioh. 17.20. <hi>I pray not for theſe alone, but for them alſo that ſhall beleeue in me through their word. How ſhall he not with him,</hi> namely, <hi>with Chriſt his Sonne, giue vs all things?</hi> and that freely, for ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies. And by <hi>all things,</hi> we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all good things, euen all the benefits of Chriſt, and all the good things of this life, ſo farre as he in wiſedome ſees needfull and meete for vs. Thus then conceiue we the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apoſtle in the words of this verſe, as if he had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who hath not withheld or kept backe that gift of the greateſt price and worth, that moſt rare and precious gift, his owne deare Sonne, the Sonne of his loue, his eternall Sonne, his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne, but hath (as the principall cauſe) giuen him or deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him vp to death for me, and you, and all true beleeuers, for all that do or ſhall beleeue in him: it cannot be but that together with that Sonne of his Chriſt Ieſus, he will freely giue vs all good things, euen all the benefits of Chriſt, and all the good things of this life, ſo farre as he in his wiſedome ſees needfull and fit for vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now firſt obſerue we, the Apoſtle here ſaith not barely, that God gaue his owne Sonne to death for his choſen, and for true beleeuers, but he ſaith, he ſpared not his owne Sonne; though his Sonne was moſt deare to him, the Sonne of his loue, yet he thought him not too deare to be giuen for his choſen, he ſpared not the moſt precious and deare thing that he had, euen his owne deare Sonne, but gaue him to death for his choſen. Hence then we are giuen to vnderſtand thus much.</p>

His giuing of his Sonne for his choſen, was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a fruite of his loue, but alſo a manifeſtation and a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the exceeding greatneſſe of his loue to them, as Chriſt ſaith, Ioh. 3.16. <hi>God ſo loued the world, that he gaue his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Sonne, that whoſoeuer beleeued in him ſhould not periſh but haue euerlaſting life.</hi> He loued his choſen, and he loued them ſo richly and ſo abundantly, as that he ſpared not his onely begotten Sonne, but gaue him for them. And as the Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 5.8. <hi>God ſetteth out his loue towards vs,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended or made his loue appeare exceeding great and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, in <hi>that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt dyed for vs.</hi> That God gaue his Sonne to dye for vs, therein he ſet forth the wonderfull greatneſſe of his loue. Nothing is dearer to a man then his owne ſonne: who knowes not the ſtrong affection of a tender hearted father towards his ſonne? common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhewes it to be exceeding great. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſhewed it in bewailing the death of his vngracious and rebellious ſonne <hi>Abſolom,</hi> 2. Sam. 18.33. <hi>O my ſonne Abſolom, my ſonne, my ſonne Abſolom: would God I had dyed for thee Abſolom, my ſonne, my ſonne.</hi> And therefore God ſet forth his loue to be wonderfull and vnſpeakeable, in that he ſent not an Angell, or an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angell, or any of his glorious creatures to dye for his choſen, but his owne deare Sonne, the Son of his loue, &amp; of the ſame eternall eſſence with his owne holy and glorious Maieſtie. Great was the loue that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhewed towards God in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was readie to offer his ſonne <hi>Iſaac</hi> at the commandement of the Lord, Gen. 22. but the loue of God to his choſen farre ſurmounteth that loue of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in that he ſpared not his owne Sonne, but gaue him to dye for them. For God loued Chriſt his Sonne better then <hi>Abraham</hi> could loue <hi>Iſaac</hi> his ſonne; Gods loue to Chriſt being infinite as his owne bleſſed Maieſtie is, and God voluntarily and freely gaue his Sonne, which <hi>Abraham</hi> would not haue done without a command. Againe <hi>Iſaac</hi> was to be offered after the manner of holy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, but Chriſt the Son of God was giuen vp to a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and an accurſed death, and ſuffered after the manner of malefactors.

And therefore doubtleſſe the loue of God in giuing his Sonne to die for his choſen, was farre beyond the loue of <hi>Abraham</hi> in offering his ſonne <hi>Iſaac.</hi> One cals the loue of God in this reſpect an hyperbole, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of loue, a miracle of loue, and the Apoſtle cals it a <hi>loue paſſing knowledge,</hi> beyond the reach of mans braine, Epheſ. 3.19.</p>

Indeed we muſt know, that we erre not in this point of weight, that Chriſt conſidered without relation to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is God of himſelfe equall to his Father, and he receiued not his Godhead from his Father, his Godhead is of it ſelfe, and Chriſt in regard of his Godhead is of himſelfe as well as the Father, but his perſon or his Sonſhip (as I may ſo ſpeake) is from the Father: and as Chriſt is the ſecond perſon in the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> and the eternall Sonne of God, ſo he is from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and was begotten of God the Father from all eternitie, and is of the ſame eternall eſſence and ſubſtance with God his Father, euen true God coeternall and coeſſentiall with God his Father.

It were eaſie further to proue the truth of the point in hand, as by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall predictions of the Prophets of God, ſpoken onely of the Lord of hoſts, of Iehouah in the old Teſtament, and applyed by the Apoſtles to Chriſt in the new Teſtament; by the workes proper to God truly aſcribed to Chriſt, as to make the world, to forgiue ſinne, to know the hearts of men, and ſuch like: yea the miracles that Chriſt wrought in the ſight of his diſciples and of his enemies, were ſo farre aboue the power of man, as that they may aſſure vs that he was the Sonne of God, as it is ſaid, Ioh. 20.30.31. <hi>Many other ſignes did Ieſus in the preſence of his diſciples, which are not written, but theſe things are written that ye might beleeue that Ieſus is the Chriſt the Sonne of God.</hi> This then we may reſolue on for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine truth, that Chriſt Ieſus who ſuffered death for the ſinnes of Gods choſen, was not onely man but God alſo, euen the Sonne of God, begotten of God his Father from all eternitie, and of the ſame eternall eſſence and ſubſtance with God his Father.

<pb n="754" facs="tcp:492:383"/> that the wrath of God is infinite againſt him for his ſinnes. Now this aſſault of Satan a child of God may refell, and beate backe on this ground, and may tell Satan, though his ſinnes be great and grieuous, and do deſerue infinite puniſhment, being committed againſt an infinite Maieſtie, yet the ſacrifice and death of Ieſus Chriſt (he being not a meere man but God alſo) is inualuable, and of infinite worth, and is able to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruaile the greatneſſe of his ſinnes, and fully to ſatisfie for them.<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>And though God be a moſt iuſt God, and his iuſtice will not be corrupted by feare, pitie, or briberie, yet it will be ſatisfied: and though the wrath of God be infinite againſt his ſinnes, yet an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſacrifice may appeaſe it and pacifie it: though the Lord will not accept the beſt thing that he can offer to him, his firſt borne for his tranſgreſſion, euen the fruite of his body for the ſinne of his ſoule,</hi> Micah 6.7. <hi>yet he will not refuſe the ſacrifice of his first begotten, yea of his onely begotten Sonne, the Sonne of his loue, and of the ſame eternall eſſence and ſubſtance with his owne Maieſtie: that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice being of infinite price and value, the Lord will not refuſe it.

If thou find thy heart turned from ſinne to God, and purged from corruption, ſurely then thy faith is a true faith, and though it be but weake, and thou art combred with much doubting, it doth as truly entitle thee to the infinite merit of the death of Chriſt the Sonne of God, as the ſtrongeſt faith of the ſoundeſt Chriſtian in the world. Thinke on that to thy comfort.</p>
               <p>Come we to the Apoſtles inference, which he brings on this propoſition, <hi>God ſpared not his owne Sonne, but gaue him for vs all to death.</hi> Hereupon the Apoſtle infers, that together with that Sonne of his, God will freely giue to all true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers all good things, which he deliuers in this manner: <hi>How ſhall he not with him giue vs all things alſo?</hi> As if he had ſaid, it cannot be but that vndoubtedly together with Chriſt his Sonne, he will giue vs all other good things. Now this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of deliuering this inference is to be obſerued: How ſhall
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:492:386"/> he not with him giue vs all things alſo: and hence we may conclude in the firſt place thus much.</p>
               <p>That it cannot be, it is not poſſible that God ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <label type="milestone">

Pſal. 84.11. the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>The Lord will withhold no good thing from them that walke vprightly.</hi> And hence it is that the Apoſtle 1. Corinth. 3.21.22. ſaith to the beleeuing Corinthians, <hi>All things are yours, whether it be Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, whether they be things preſent or things to come, all are yours.</hi> And he makes this the ground of it, <hi>Ye are Chriſts,</hi> ye beleeue in Chriſt, ye belong to Chriſt, &amp; Chriſt is yours; and therefore all things are yours, and it cannot be that God ſhould ſuffer you to want any thing that he ſees meete and good for you. And not to enlarge the proofe of this truth, the grounds of it are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God who is infinite in power, goodneſſe and mercie, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> hath giuen Chriſt his Sonne to all true beleeuers, the greateſt good that can be giuen, and therefore he will not denie them things of leſſe worth.

               </p>
               <p>Againe, Chriſt is the fountaine of all good things, in and through him God doth bleſſe his children <hi>with all ſpirituall bleſſings,</hi> Epheſ. 1.3. yea with all temporall bleſſings, and with all good things: and therefore they hauing Chriſt, they can want no good thing.

               <p>There is yet further matter of inſtruction offered to vs from this inference of the Apoſtle, <hi>How ſhall he not with him giue vs all things alſo?</hi> And in the next place obſerue we, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here ſaith, How ſhall not God with Chriſt giue vs all things? as if he had ſaid, It cannot be but that God will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Chriſt freely giue vs both all the benefits of Chriſt, and all other good things of this life which he in his wiſedome ſees meete and good for vs. Now hence note we thus much.</p>
               <p>That Chriſt and the benefits of Chriſt cannot be ſeuered: <label type="milestone">

               <p>Againe, they affirme that the imputation of Chriſt his righteouſneſſe to true beleeuers is but a fancie. We hold that Chriſt his righteouſneſſe is truly and really imputed to euerie true beleeuer: they ſay it is but a putatiue iuſtice, ſo they ſcornfully terme it, and a meere ſuppoſed imputation, and a meere imagination.

               <p>Now in a ſecond place, in that the Apoſtle here ſaith, <hi>With him:</hi> that is, with Chriſt, euen together with Chriſt God giues to true beleeuers not onely all the benefits of Chriſt, but all other good things of this life that he ſees meete and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for them.

If thou know thy ſelfe by faith to be a member of Chriſt, his right giues thee right and title to the good creatures of God thou doſt enioy, and thou maiſt lawfully vſe them for thy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, yea ſometimes for thy honeſt delight; the beautie, ſweetneſſe, and comfort of them belongs to thee, and thou maiſt eate with peace and drinke with peace, ſo as it be with moderation and thankſgiuing to God, and thou maiſt with peace and comfort poſſeſſe and vſe gold and ſiluer, and other good things of this life the Lord is pleaſed to caſt on thee by his good hand and prouidence: thinke on that to thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vr Apoſtle hauing in the verſe foregoing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the beleeuing Romans and other true beleeuers, againſt the aſſault and tentation that might ariſe from the want of good things, and made knowne to them they need not feare the want of any good thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them, God hauing giuen them Chriſt his Sonne, he now begins to arme and ſtrengthen them againſt the aſſaults and tentations that might come from the preſence of euill things, and he oppoſeth to the particular aſſaults that might trouble and diſquiet them touching the preſence of euill things, contrary grounds of comfort: and this he doth from this 33. verſe to the end of the Chapter. I will God willing lay forth the grounds of comfort oppoſed to the particular aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, as we ſhall come to them. In theſe two verſes 33. and 34. the Apoſtle pus downe a ground of comfort that might come from the euill of ſinne, and he ſhewes that the euill of ſinne cannot hurt Gods choſen, either in regard of accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in reſpect of condemnation. Firſt in regard of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, he affirmes verſe 33. that Gods choſen are not to feare any accuſer, any that can accuſe them for their ſinnes, which he puts downe by way of interrogation, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen?</hi> And then againſt the feare of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation for their ſinnes, he oppoſeth a ſtrong reaſon, as a ground of comfort, becauſe God iuſtifieth them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no accuſation for ſinne need to be feared: <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen? It is God that iuſtifieth,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. In regard of condemnation he likewiſe
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:492:392"/> affirmes verſe 34. that Gods choſen are not to feare that any ſhall condemne them for their ſinnes. <hi>Who ſhall condemne,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: as if he had ſaid, None ſhall, or none can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne. And then he alſo oppoſeth to the feare of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation this reaſon and particular ground of comfort, becauſe Chriſt is dead: <hi>It is Chriſt which is dead.</hi> Which he further enlargeth by Chriſt his reſurrection, and his ſitting at the right hand of God, and his interceſſion: <hi>It is Chriſt which is dead, yea or rather which is riſen againe, who is alſo at the right hand of God, and maketh requeſt alſo for vs.</hi> But to keepe within the compaſſe of verſe 33. two things in generall are layd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs in that verſe. Firſt this propoſition: None can lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen, deliuered by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen?</hi> Secondly the reaſon of it, becauſe God iuſtifieth them, <hi>Who can lay any thing to their charge?

               <p>Let vs now a little ſtand to examine the words of this verſe touching the ſence and meaning of them.<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen?</hi> as if he had ſaid, none ſhall, or none can, neither man nor diuell, none either in heauen, in earth, or in hell, is able to do it. <hi>Lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen.</hi> Theſe words are metaphoricall, borrowed and taken from ciuill courts, and the verbe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, vſed in the originall, properly ſignifieth to call one into law, to enter action or ſuite againſt him in ſome open Court, to endite him, to accuſe him with ſome euill, and to charge him with ſome crime before a Iudge: and ſo the meaning of the Apoſtle is this, None is able to indite Gods choſen, or to accuſe them, or to charge them with any crime before the tribunall and iudgement ſeate of God, ſo as they are not able there to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt them by their inditement or accuſation, and to conuince them as guiltie of any crime. Indeed Gods choſen haue many accuſers, and many there be that are readie to charge ſinne on them; but the words of the Apoſtle carrie this ſence, None are able in truth to faſten any crime or any guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe on them. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen?</hi> that is, of ſuch as God hath in his eternall loue, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:492:392"/> and choſen, and ſet apart <hi>before the foundation of the world,</hi> as Epheſ. 1.4. to eternall life, they now truly beleeuing in Chriſt; for thoſe the Apoſtle here cals Gods choſen, whom before he ſaid were fore-knowne of God, predeſtinate, and called according to his purpoſe. <hi>It is God that iuſtifieth:</hi> the words are in the originall <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>God iuſtifying, or God who iuſtifieth,</hi> and ſome reade theſe words by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation thus: Who ſhall lay anything to the charge of Gods choſen, ſhall God who iuſtifieth? but that reading ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcures the ſence, and the words are better thus read, <hi>It is God that iuſtifieth.</hi> The word <hi>iuſtifie</hi> is diuerſly taken in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there be two ſpeciall ſignifications of the word, as firſt it ſignifies to acknowledge or to declare one to be iuſt; and in this ſence it is taken, Matth. 12.37. <hi>By thy words thou art iuſtified,</hi> that is, by thy words thou ſhalt be declared to be iuſt, for words do not make but declare a man to be iuſt or vniuſt. So Luke 7.29. it is ſaid, <hi>The people that heard Chriſt, and the publicans iuſtified God,</hi> which muſt be vnderſtood thus, they acknowledged God to be iuſt, or they approued the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the word <hi>iustifie,</hi> is a iudiciall tearme, borrowed from the Courts of iuſtice, &amp; it ſignifies a iudiciall act, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to abſolue, and to acquit in iudgement, or to pronounce innocent in iudgement: in which ſence the word is vſed, Acts 13.39. <hi>And from all things from which ye could not be iuſtified by the Law of Moſes, by him is iustified:</hi> that is, abſolued or cleared. The words can ſignifie no other thing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abſolution from ſinne, and in this ſence is the word here vſed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle: and that is cleare, in that he here ſets it againſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and condemning, which are two acts of iudgement, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen, and who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne? It is God that iuſtifieth:</hi> and ſo his meaning is, It is God who doth abſolue and acquit his choſen now beleeuing in Chriſt, from the guilt of all their ſinnes, and doth account or pronounce them innocent and iuſt in his ſight through Chriſt his Sonne. Thus then conceiue we the Apoſtles meaning in the words of this verſe, as if he had ſaid.</p>
               <pb n="772" facs="tcp:492:393"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who is able to accuſe them whom God hath choſen, and ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part before the foundation of the world to life eternall, now truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing in Chriſt, or to charge them with any crime before the iudgement ſeate of God, ſo as they are able there to make their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation good, and there to preuaile againſt them, by their accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to conuince them as guiltie of any crime? Surely none, either in heauen, in earth, or in hell, is able to do it, for it is God who doth abſolue and acquit them from the guilt of all their ſinnes, and doth account or pronounce them innocent and iuſt in his ſight through Chriſt his Sonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now firſt in that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen? they being iuſtified of God:</hi> hereby he implies, that Gods choſen now beleeuing in Chriſt, and iuſtified in the ſight of God, are lyable to be accuſed, and to haue ſinne layd to their charge. The Apoſtle doth not here exempt Gods choſen, now beleeuing in Chriſt, and iuſtified by Chriſt, altogether from accuſation, and from all trouble in reſpect of ſinne, but from being hurt by any accuſation for their ſinnes: he ſaith none is able to lay any ſinne to them, ſo as they can preuaile againſt them by their accuſation before Gods tribunall. Hence then we may gather in the firſt place.</p>

And thus as the Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 4.5. <hi>God iustifieth the vngodly:</hi> that is, God acquitteth ſuch as are vngodly in themſelues, and haue vngodlineſſe in themſelues, looking on them in Chriſt his Sonne, who hath fully ſatisfied for their ſinnes.</p>

                  </label> againe. True beleeuers and iuſtified perſons haue need daily to craue pardon of ſinne, though they be acquitted of God from the guilt of all their ſinnes, becauſe they daily commit new ſinnes, and though thoſe new ſinnes be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of God, and with God they are accounted as if they had not bene done in regard of the guiltineſſe, he ſtill looking on their perſons in Chriſt, yet in reſpect of themſelues, and of the actuall being of thoſe ſinnes, they are day by day actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. And againe, the aſſurance that true beleeuers haue of the pardon of their ſinnes, is but weake, and had need to be further ſtrengthened, and they are to pray for the pardon of their ſinnes more and more to ſtrengthen them in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the pardon of thoſe ſinnes they daily commit, and of
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:492:396"/> all their other ſinnes. And therefore this ſtill remaines a truth, that Gods choſen now beleeuing in Chriſt, and iuſtified of God, God iuſtifying them in and through Chriſt his Sonne, they cannot be hurt by any accuſation for ſinne that can be brought againſt them before the iudgement ſeate of God, and they need not feare any accuſer or any accuſation layed againſt them before Gods iudgement ſeate, either by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, or by the world, or by their owne conſciences for their ſinnes. What folly then is it either in the diuell, or in the <label type="milestone">

               <p>Now, is it ſo that Gods choſen, now beleeuing in Chriſt, <label type="milestone">

What though theſe enemies trouble and diſquiet them; yet they dare not appeare before God to accuſe them, and to charge ſinne on their ſoules: if they do, it is but loſt labour, they cannot preuaile by any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation they bring againſt them. And on this ground a child of God, a true beleeuer, may chalenge the diuell, and all the enemies of his ſaluation, and euen dare them to come with him before Gods tribunall and iudgement ſeate, and he may boldly ſay to Satan, thou art euer troubling me, and ſetting before me my guiltineſſe of ſinne, I dare thee Satan, or any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie of my ſoule to come with me before the holy Maieſtie of God, and there if thou dareſt to accuſe me, and if thou da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſo do, I feare thee not, I know thou ſhalt not preuaile by any accuſation thou canſt bring againſt me; God himſelfe the higheſt Iudge hath acquitted me from the guilt of all my ſinnes. What an excellent comfort is this to euery child of God, and to euery true beleeuer? And this comfort belongs to thee whoſoeuer thou art, that haſt good euidence of true grace in thine heart, and that thou truly beleeueſt in Chriſt. What though it be ſo that thou art traduced by men, &amp; men charge foule things on thee, that thou art an hypocrite? com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thy ſelfe in this, they dare not ſtand to their accuſation, and charge thee ſo to be before the iudgement ſeate of God; thou maiſt chalenge them, and dare them, and ſtand at defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them. <label type="milestone">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Verſe (as I haue ſaid) the Apoſtle la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to ſtrengthen Gods choſen againſt the feare of condemnation for their ſinnes, and to that purpoſe he here affirmes that none can condemne Gods choſen: which poſition he puts downe as he did the former, by way of interrogation, who ſhall condemne? as if he had ſaid, None is able to condemne Gods choſen. Then he brings a reaſon as a ground of comfort againſt the feare of condemnation, from
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:492:398"/> the death of Chriſt, that Chriſt is dead for Gods choſen, and therefore they need not feare condemnation for their ſinnes: <hi>Who ſhall condemne? it is Chriſt which is dead.</hi> And that reaſon and ground of comfort the Apoſtle further amplifies by the reſurrection of Chriſt, and by his ſitting at the right hand of his Father in heauen, and by his interceſſion for them: and in thoſe foure things the Apoſtle goes on by degrees, preuenting all ſcruples and doubts that might trouble the minds of Gods choſen touching condemnation: none can condemne them: why? becauſe Chriſt is dead for them, ſaith the Apoſtle. But might ſome ſay, what can Chriſt being dead profit vs? Indeed nothing at all if he had bene ſwallowed vp of death, but he is riſen againe, and hath ouercome death: <hi>yea or rather which is riſen againe.</hi> And not onely ſo, but he alſo ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at the right hand of God, and hath receiued all power for the ſafetie of Gods choſen now beleeuing in him: and not onely ſo, but he alſo is continually exerciſed in making inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for them. <hi>It is Chriſt which is dead, or rather which is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen againe, who is alſo at the right hand of God, and maketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt for vs.</hi> And ſo we ſee the generall drift of the Apoſtle in this verſe.</p>
               <p>Come we to the opening of the words of it,<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> touching the ſence and meaning of them. <hi>Who ſhall.</hi> That is as if he had ſaid, None ſhall, or none can, none in heauen, in earth, or in hell, is able to do it. <hi>Condemne.</hi> The word <hi>condemne</hi> is here alſo a iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall terme, and it ſignifies the act of a Iudge in open court, whoſe act is to adiudge ſuch as are found guilty of any crime, and iuſtly deſerue puniſhment, to death, or to ſome other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. And the word here is to be vnderſtood with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſinne, as it is vſed, Rom. 5.18. <hi>By the offence of one.</hi> And ſo the meaning is, none can pronounce Gods choſen now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing in Chriſt, worthy of puniſhment for ſinne, or truly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudge them to any puniſhment, either temporall or eternall for their ſinnes. <hi>It is Chriſt which is dead:</hi> the words are <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="784" facs="tcp:492:399"/> a reaſon why none can condemne Gods choſen, becauſe Chriſt is dead for them, and by his death hath made a full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to God for their ſinnes, his death being of infinite price and value, and fully anſwerable to the iuſtice of God, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. Pet. 2.24. <hi>He his owne ſelfe bare our ſinnes in his bodie on the tree.</hi> According to that, Iſai. 53.5. <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was broken for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was vpon him, and with his ſtripes are we healed.</hi> And ſo the meaning of the Apoſtle is, that none can condemne Gods choſen, now beleeuing in Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt hath dyed for them, and hath by his death fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for all their ſinnes, and hath borne that puniſhment that they ſhould haue borne for their ſinnes. <hi>Yea or rather which is riſen againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> this is a further ground of comfort, and hereby the Apoſtle meanes that Chriſt is not onely dead for the ſins of Gods choſen, but is alſo riſen againe from the dead, and hath vanquiſhed and ouercome death, and made it manifeſt by his reſurrection that he hath fully abſolued and diſcharged them from all their ſinnes: as Rom. 4.25. <hi>He was deliuered to death for our ſinnes, and is riſen againe for our iuſtification. Who is alſo at the right hand of God.</hi> Theſe words <hi>right hand of God,</hi> are vſed by way of ſimilitude, they are metaphoricall; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in proper ſpeech God hath neither right hand nor left, he is a Spirit infinite and incomprehenſible: and theſe words ſet out the glorious ſtate of Chriſt in heauen, that he is there aduanced to an vnſpeakeable height of glorie: they are taken from the manner of the kings of the earth, who vſe to ſet thoſe on high whom they purpoſe moſt of all to honour. As 1. King. 2.19. <hi>Salomon</hi> in token of honour <hi>cauſed a ſeate to be ſet for his mother, and ſhe ſate at his right hand.</hi> And by this forme of ſpeech here rightly applyed to Chriſt, 2. things are ſignified.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That <hi>Chriſt is exalted to vnſpeakeable glorie in heauen,</hi> 1. Tim. 3.16. and is there partaker of the infinite glorie of his Father. And</p>
               <p>Secondly, that Chriſt is exalted to the full adminiſtration of his kingdome, to be the head of his Church, and with his
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:492:399"/> Father to be Lord and gouernour of all things in heauen and earth, <hi>Hauing all power giuen to him, both in heauen and in earth,</hi> as himſelfe ſaith, Matth. 28.18. and as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. Pet. 3.22. <hi>He is at the right hand of God gone into heauen, to whom the Angels, and powers, and might are ſubiect.</hi> Theſe two things are here intended by the Apoſtle, in ſaying that Chriſt is at the right hand of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And maketh requeſt or interceſſion alſo for vs.</hi> Theſe words are not to be conceiued as if Chriſt now in heauen did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate himſelfe and kneele on his knees, and vtter words of prayer to God his Father, as he did in the dayes of his fleſh, but Chriſt doth now make requeſt by the merit of his death, he now preſenting himſelfe continually in the ſight of God his Father, as Heb. 9.24. <hi>He is entred into very heauen to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare now in the ſight of God for vs:</hi> and by preſenting the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of himſelfe once offered on the croſſe, and the infinite merit of that ſacrifice before the eyes of his Father, willing as he is God and man, and deſiring as he is man, that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would accept of his perfect ſatisfaction, and turne away his eyes from the indignities and ſinnes of his choſen, and be well pleaſed with them, in and through him. <hi>For vs,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, that is, for me and you, and for all true beleeuers. Now then thus take we vp the ſence and meaning of the words of this verſe, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who can pronounce Gods choſen, now beleeuing in Chriſt, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of puniſhment for ſinne, or truly iudge them to any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either temporall or eternall for their ſinnes? Surely none in heauen, in earth, or in hell can do it: for why, Chriſt hath died for them, and by his death which was of infinite worth, hath fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for all their ſinnes, and hath borne that puniſhment that they ſhould haue borne for their ſinnes: and not onely ſo, but Chriſt hath vanquiſhed and ouercome death, and made it manifeſt by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, that he hath fully abſolued and diſcharged them from all their ſinnes, and he is now alſo exalted to vnspeakeable glorie in heauen, and to the full adminiſtration of his kingdome, to be the head of his Church, and with his Father to be Lord and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of all things in heauen and earth; and he doth now alſo make

               </p>
               <p>Now firſt in that the Apoſtle puts downe this for a certaine truth, that none can condemne Gods choſen now beleeuing in Chriſt, none can adiudge them to any puniſhment, either temporall or eternall for their ſinnes, and then giues this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, it is Chriſt which is dead, becauſe Chriſt hath died for them; hence in the firſt place we are giuen to vnderſtand thus much.</p>

               <p>Againe, the Law of God hath no power to binde true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers for whom Chriſt died to the curſe of the Law for the tranſgreſſion of it, becauſe Chriſt by his death hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them from the curſe, in that he was made a curſe for them, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes plainly, Galat. 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed vs, when he was made a curſe for vs.</hi>

Surely then here is a ground of
<pb n="790" facs="tcp:492:402"/> ſweet and of admirable and heauenly comfort for euery true beleeuer, for euery one who is ſure that he hath part in the death of Chriſt: this truth tels thee, whoſoeuer thou art that art a true beleeuer, and haſt part in the death of Chriſt, that thou art in a moſt happie and bleſſed ſtate and condition, thou needeſt not feare the yelling and roaring of the diuell thundering out hell and damnation for ſinne, nor the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſentence of the Law of God, denouncing iudgement and the curſe for euery tranſgreſſion of it: no, nor yet the ſinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging iuſtice of God, which is moſt ſtrict, and moſt ſharpe and ſeuere againſt all vngodlineſſe and wrong: and what an happie and bleſſed ſtate is that? How may the conſideration of this affect thy ſoule, and fill thine heart with comfort and ioy vnſpeakeable? We know, if a man that is to ſtand before an earthly Iudge to be tried touching ſome matter of crime, perſwade himſelfe that neither any enemy of his, though moſt malicious and thirſting after bloud, hath power to require ſentence againſt him, nor the law it ſelfe hath power to bind him ouer to any penaltie, nor yet the Iudge himſelfe, if he deale truly, can adiudge him to any puniſhment, it is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous comfort to him, and it cheeres him vp exceedingly: though indeed the law of man may be wreſted, and an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iudge may be carried aſide, and may giue vniuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet this is his comfort, that neither his enemie, nor the Law it ſelfe, nor the Iudge himſelfe can iuſtly proceed againſt him, &amp; adiudge him to any puniſhment. Oh how much more may it cheare vp thy heart, thou that art a child of God, truly beleeuing in Chriſt, and haſt part in the death of Chriſt, and on that ground art ſure of this, that neither the diuell that thirſts after thy bloud and the precious life of thy ſoule, nor the Law of God, which is terrible in the curſe of it againſt vnbeleeuers, nor yet the iuſtice of God, which cannot but giue ſentence of damnation againſt vnrepentant ſinners, that none of theſe can truly adiudge thee to any puniſhment, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temporall or eternall for thy ſinnes? Thinke on this to thy comfort when thou art troubled with the ſight of thy ſinnes, yea euen of thoſe ſinnes thou haſt often fallen into of weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:492:402"/> and againſt thy purpoſe and holy reſolution to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie: and when thou art troubled with feare of puniſhment due to thee for thy ſinnes, oh then call to mind this ground of comfort, that Chriſt hath ſuffered that puniſhment that thou ſhouldſt haue vndergone for all thy ſinnes, and that he was condemned in thy roome, and in thy ſtead, and that he hath fully ſatisfied the iuſtice of God for thy ſinne; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the iuſtice of God thou canſt not be condemned. No, know it to thy comfort, it is as poſſible for thee to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for any of thy ſinnes, though often fallen into of weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and committed after thy true beleeuing in Chriſt, as it is for God to be vniuſt, which is impoſſible: and what a ſweet comfort may that be to thy ſoule? Exerciſe thy thoughts in this ground of comfort, yea exerciſe thy faith in it, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour thou more and more to be ſetled in this ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Many poore Chriſtians wrong themſelues exceedingly, in that they meaſure their happie eſtate &amp; condition by their feeling of comfort: when their feelings faile them, then they call all into queſtion. Oh learne then to meaſure thy happie ſtate and condition by this, that thou art a true beleeuer, and haſt part in the death of Chriſt, and ſo art in ſuch a bleſſed ſtate and condition as thou canſt not be condemned for any of thy ſinnes, no not for thoſe ſinnes that haue depriued thee of the feeling of comfort: and how may this cheere vp thine heart? Surely the due conſideration of this may cheere thee vp, and comfort thee againſt the feare of that which followes after death; for howſoeuer as we haue it, Hebr. 9 27. <hi>After death comes iudgement,</hi> and hereupon to the wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers death is moſt terrible, and the * <hi>king of feare,</hi> as <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi> cals it, Iob 18.14.<note place="margin">Iob 18.14. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Come we now to the Apoſtles amplification of his reaſon, and ground of comfort and ſtrength againſt the feare of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, from the death of Chriſt.

This reaſon and ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our Apoſtle further enlargeth by the reſurrection of
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:492:404"/> Chriſt, and by his ſitting at the right hand of God in heauen, and by his making interceſſion there for God choſen; that Chriſt is not onely dead for Gods choſen, but is alſo riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine from the dead, aſcended vp into heauen, and now ſits at the right hand of God in heauen, and there makes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall interceſſion for Gods choſen.

Now if Chriſt dyed for all, and roſe not againe for all, then he ſuffered death for ſome for whom he neuer ouercame death, which is very abſurd and groſſe once to thinke, and cleane contrarie to this text of the Apoſtle, he here conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the death of Chriſt, his reſurrection, and interceſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Againe, in that the Apoſtle here limits and reſtraines the death of Chriſt, &amp; his reſurrection, his ſitting at the right hand of God, and his interceſſion, onely to Gods choſen, it makes directly againſt vniuerſall redemption wrought by the death of Chriſt,<note place="margin">The Arminia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conceit of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by the death of Chriſt confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> and held likewiſe by the Arminians and others: for if Chriſt redeemed all vniuerſally by his death, then he alſo roſe againe for all, and ſits at the right hand of God for all, and makes continuall interceſſion for all, which is directly contrary to the plaine euidence of this text, and ſo erronious and falſe. Let it ſuffice to haue touched theſe things in a word.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the firſt degree of the Apoſtles amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Yea or rather which is riſen againe:</hi> that is, as I ſhewed,
<pb n="796" facs="tcp:492:405"/> it is Chriſt which is dead for the ſinnes of Gods choſen, and not onely ſo, but he is riſen againe, and hath vanquiſhed death, and made it manifeſt by his riſing againe that he hath fully abſolued and diſcharged them from all their ſinnes: that is the purpoſe of the Apoſtle in theſe words, <hi>Yea or rather which is riſen againe.</hi> Hence then we haue ground for this point of diuine truth, it is hence plainly offered to vs.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> That Chriſt his riſing from the dead is a manifeſtation of the full redemption wrought by the death of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Chriſt his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the dead is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption wrought by his death.</note> Indeed the reſurrection of Chriſt did adde nothing to the price of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption which was paid in the death of Chriſt, yet it is a plaine euidence and demonſtration of the full redemption wrought by the death of Chriſt. By his riſing from the dead he hath made himſelfe knowne to be a moſt Almightie, ſtrong, and powerfull Sauiour and redeemer, and hath made it manifeſt that by his death and bloud ſhedding he hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly redeemed Gods choſen beleeuing in him from all their ſinnes, and ſet them free from ſinne, from hell, from death, and from damnation, and from all puniſhment due to them for ſinne, both temporall and eternall. And for this we haue euidence in other places of Scripture. Rom. 1.4. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt was declared mightily to be the Sonne of God, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Spirit of ſanctification, by the reſurrection from the dead:</hi> and ſo a moſt powerfull, mightie, and ſtrong Sauiour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer by his reſurrection from the dead. And Rom. 4.25. he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt was deliuered to death for our ſinnes, and is riſen againe for our iuſtification.</hi> His meaning is, that the reſurrection of Chriſt is an euident demonſtration of our iuſtification, that is, of our acquitting and full diſcharge from all our ſins (we beleeuing in Chriſt) purchaſed by the death of Chriſt. And hence it is that the Apoſtle puts it downe for a certaine truth, 1. Corinth. 15.17. that <hi>if Chriſt be not riſen our faith is vaine, we that beleeue in Chriſt are yet in our ſinnes:</hi> we are not yet freed from the guilt and puniſhment due for our ſinnes. Where we ſee he makes the clearing of Gods choſen from their ſinnes, and ſetting of them free from ſinne, and from hell and damnation, and the reſurrection of Chriſt, to go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="797" facs="tcp:492:405"/> that if Chriſt be riſen from the dead, then they are free from ſinne: if he be not riſen from the dead, they are yet in their ſinnes. And ſo be ſtrongly confirmes the truth of the point in hand, that Chriſt his riſing from the dead is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the full and perfect redemption wrought by the death of Chriſt; and he thereby hath made himſelfe knowne to be a moſt mightie, ſtrong, and powerfull Sauiour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and thereby manifeſted that by his death he hath fully redeemed Gods choſen from all their ſinnes, and ſet them free from hell, from death and damnation, and from all puniſhment for ſinne, both temporall and eternall: and the reaſon and ground of it is this.</p>
               <p>Chriſt became ſuretie for Gods choſen, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> and he vndertooke to pay that which was due for their ſinnes, and to ſatisfie for them, and to be anſwerable to his Father for their ſinnes, and he voluntarily and of his owne accord did ſubmit himſelfe to death for the ſinnes of Gods choſen, and put himſelfe vnder the power of death, as he ſaith, Ioh. 10.18. <hi>No man taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way my life, but I lay it downe of my ſelfe.</hi> Chriſt by voluntarie diſpenſation hauing thus taken on him the ſinnes of Gods choſen, and to ſatisfie for them, and hauing of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord put himſelfe vnder the power of death, if he had not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for the ſinnes of Gods choſen to the full, he had not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen againe; if any one of their ſinnes had not bene ſatisfied for by him he had not riſen from the dead, or being riſen, he ſhould returne againe to dye: for where ſinne remaines vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for, there of neceſſitie death hath power, it being the ſtipend of ſinne: but Chriſt being raiſed from the dead dyeth no more, <hi>Death hath no more power or dominion ouer him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, Rom. 6.9. And therefore doubtleſſe Chriſt his riſing from the dead is a manifeſtation of the full redemption wrought by the death of Chriſt, and thereby Chriſt hath made himſelfe knowne to be a moſt mightie, ſtrong, and powerfull Sauiour and redeemer, and hath made it manifeſt that by his death he hath fully redeemed Gods choſen from all their ſinnes, and ſet them free from ſinne, from hell, from death, and from damnation, and from all puniſhment for

               <p>And for the vſe, this ground of truth ſerues to teach vs a ſpeciall comfort, that we may take from the conſideration of the reſurrection of Chriſt. We being true beleeuers, we are not to make the reſurrection of Chriſt a matter of ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of knowledge onely, but a ground of comfort:<note place="margin">The reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt ought to be vnto vs not a matter of ſpeculatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; knowledge onely, but a ground of comfort, and what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort we may thence gather diſcouered.</note> and the due conſideration of it ought to teach vs thus much for our comfort, that we may ſafely and ſecurely reſt on the death of Chriſt as a full ſatisfaction for all our ſinnes. Yea on this ground, that Chriſt is riſen from the dead, we may be aſſured of it to our comfort (we being true beleeuers) that none of our ſinnes are vnexpiated or vnſatisfied for by the death of Chriſt, no not our moſt hainous ſins, no not thoſe wherein we haue continued long, and haue doubled and repeated often, no not thoſe we haue done with much boldneſſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; we now beleeuing in Chriſt, and hauing good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of it that we are true beleeuers, we may aſſure our ſelues that we haue full deliuerance and freedome from the guilt and puniſhment of all our ſinnes by the death of Chriſt: and Chriſt by his riſing from the dead hath made it manifeſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by his death, and by the ſhedding of his bloud he hath fully redeemed vs from all our ſinnes, and ſet vs free from ſin, from hell, from death, and from condemnation, and that he as our <hi>Sampſon</hi> hath carried away the gates of death, yea the gates of hell, &amp; <hi>the gates of death and of hell ſhall neuer be able to preuaile against vs.</hi> And what a ſweet comfort may that be to vs if we duly conſider it? Thinke on it to thy comfort thou that art a true beleeuer; and when thou art troubled and terrified with the ſight of thy moſt foule and hainous ſinnes, and they grate and rub on thy conſcience, and the diuell he gals thee with the remembrance of them, then conſider to thy comfort that none of thy ſinnes, no not the moſt hainous and fouleſt of them, ſhall ſinke thee to hell, and bring damnation on thee, Chriſt hath dyed for them, yea he is riſen againe from death, and hath made it manifeſt to men and Angels, and the diuell himſelfe cannot denie it, but that by his riſing againe he hath giuen euident demonſtration of it, that by his death he hath
<pb n="799" facs="tcp:492:406"/> fully ſatisfied for thy fouleſt ſinne, and for all thy other ſinnes, and freed thee for euer from the guilt and puniſhment of them all. For thou being a true beleeuer, aſſuredly Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke to ſatisfie for all thy ſinnes, and he put himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of death for thy ſinnes; and if any of thy ſinnes had not bene ſatisfied for, he had not riſen from the dead, but now he being riſen from the dead, thou maiſt thereupon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thy ſelfe and build on it, that by his death he hath fully redeemed the from ſinne, from hell, and from damnation, and from all puniſhment for thy ſinnes, both temporall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Oh then thinke on this to thy comfort, and giue the Lord Ieſus his due honour, reſt on him and on his death as a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and deliuerance of thee from all thy ſinnes: yea know to thy comfort, that Chriſt is able, and he will alſo free thee from the power of ſinne, yea from the power of that ſinne that is moſt ſtrong and powerfull in thee. He tooke our nature on him to chaſe ſinne and death out of it, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, 1. Ioh. 3.8. <hi>He appeared that he might looſe the workes of the diuell.</hi> And hath he broken the barres of death when he was vnder the power of it, and hath he ouercome ſinne and death by his riſing from the dead, and will he now leaue thee for whom he dyed and roſe againe, and ſet free from ſinne, hell, death, and damnation, vnder the power of ſinne? Was he able to breake the barres and gates of death when he was vnder the power of it,<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>and is he not now much more able to break into thy dead ſoule, and to free thee from the deadneſſe of heart, and the like of which thou complaineſt? Will he leaue thee vnder the power of corruption? No, no, he is able to free thee, and he will in his good time free thee from the power of thy ſtrongeſt corruption and ſinne:</hi> thinke on that to thy comfort.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the ſecond degree of the Apoſtles ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his reaſon and ground of comfort taken from the death of Chriſt, <hi>It is Christ which is dead, yea or rather which is riſen againe:</hi> and he addes further, <hi>Who is alſo at the right hand of God,</hi> that is (as I ſhewed) who is now exalted to vnſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble glorie in heauen, and to the full adminiſtration of his kingdome, to be the head of his Church, and with his Father

Diuerſe particulars might from hence be deriued, but I deſire to point out thoſe things that are proper to this place: and two things eſpecially are here offered, I will ſpeake of them in order.

So Chriſt Ieſus being now gone vp into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, he there preſents to his Father the names of all his choſen, and remembers them to his Father, and by the merit of his death procures mercie for them continually. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is that a plaine text, Heb. 7.24 25. where the holy Ghoſt comparing Chriſt his prieſthood with the Leuiticall prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he prefers his before that, in reſpect of the perpetuitie of it, and he ſaith, the Leuiticall Prieſts were many, there was a ſucceſſion and a paſſing of that prieſthood from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe they were not ſuffered to endure by the reaſon of

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> we may not thinke that Chriſt is aſcended to heauen, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced to the right hand of God, onely there to liue in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happineſſe himſelfe, and to enioy for himſelfe a bleſſed life onely, but to procure alſo happineſſe for all his members, and that he there liues for euer to excellent purpoſe, and to the great good of his Church and of all his members: he there ſits at the right hand of God, aduanced to vnſpeakable glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and power, gouerning and protecting his Church and the members of it in wiſedome and power alſo, continually executing the office of his prieſthood for the good of his Church. And therefore this we may reſolue on as a certaine truth, that Chriſt Ieſus hath not onely died for the ſinnes of Gods choſen, and by his death fully ſatisfied for their ſinnes, and ſo performed that part of his prieſthood, but he is riſen from the dead, and aſcended vp into heauen, and he there makes continuall interceſſion by the merit of his death for all Gods choſen now beleeuing in him; he there preſents himſelfe and the ſacrifice of himſelfe, and the infinite merit of that ſacrifice continually before the eyes of his Father, and he thereby cauſeth his Father to turne away his eyes from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities and ſinnes of all his true beleeuing members, and he procures his Fathers face and fauour towards them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. <label type="milestone">

               <p>I will firſt open the ſence and meaning of the words of this 35. verſe. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate vs.</hi> As if the Apoſtle had ſaid,<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> None ſhall, or none can, neither the diuell nor any inſtrument of his can do it, by any euill they can bring on vs; I defie them all, as to be able to <hi>ſeparate vs:</hi> that is me, or you, or any other true beleeuer. <hi>From the loue of Chriſt.</hi> Some would haue the loue of Chriſt here to be taken actiuely, for that loue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we loue Chriſt; but indeed it is better to take it paſſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that loue wherewith we are beloued of Chriſt, that is more agreeable to the context and purpoſe of the Apoſtle, hauing before ſpoken of Chriſt his loue to his choſen now beleeuing in him, teſtified by his dying for them, his riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and by his ſitting at the right hand of God, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king interceſſion for them: and the Apoſtle himſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
<pb n="814" facs="tcp:492:414"/> it of Gods loue to vs in Chriſt, verſe 37. and 39. and the word <hi>ſeparate</hi> leades vs thus to vnderſtand it; for we are not properly ſaid to be ſeparated from our ſelues, or from our owne loue, but from another, or from the loue of another. <hi>Shall tribulation, or anguiſh, or perſecution, or famine, or naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or perill, or ſword?</hi> As if he had ſaid, neither tribulation, nor anguiſh, nor perſecution, nor famine, nor nakedneſſe, nor perill, nor ſword, ſhall be able or can ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt. By <hi>tribulation</hi> is meant any preſſure or vexation by impriſonment, bonds, baniſhment, or the like. <hi>Anguiſh or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe.</hi> The word ſignifieth properly ſtraightneſſe of place, and it is here vſed metaphorically for perplexitie of mind, when one knowes not what to do, or which way to turne himſelfe, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid, 2. Sam. 24.14. <hi>I am in a wonderfull ſtraite. Or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</hi> The word <hi>perſecution</hi> ſignifies the extreme violence vſed to Gods children by tyrants and wicked men, whereby they do hunt them and chaſe them vp and downe, and purſue them from place to place, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid, 1. Sam. 24.15. <hi>Whom doſt thou purſue?</hi> And Chap. 26.20. that <hi>Saul hunted him as one would hunt a partrich in the mountaines. Or famine, or nakedneſſe.</hi> Theſe are knowne things, one ſignifieth want of foode to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine life, and the other want of clothing to couer and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the body from the iniury of weather. <hi>Or perill.</hi> By <hi>perill</hi> is meant any dangerous diſtreſſe, whereby the life of man is in great hazard, ſuch as the Apoſtle ſpeakes of, 2. Corinth. 11.26. <hi>Or ſword.</hi> By <hi>ſword</hi> we are to vnderſtand any kind of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſlaughter, and cruell tormenting death; as Hebr. 11.37. it is ſaid, they <hi>were ſlaine with the ſword.</hi> Thus then conceiue we the Apoſtles meaning in the words of this verſe, as if he had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who is able to ſeparate me, or you, or any true beleeuer, from that loue wherewith we are beloued of Chriſt, or to make vs leſſe beloued of him? Surely, neither the diuell nor any inſtrument of his, can do it by any euill they can bring on vs. Is any preſſure or vexation, or any perplexitie of mind, or any extreme violence vſed to vs by tyrants and wicked men, whereby they purſue vs from place to place, or is want of neceſſarie food, or want of neceſſarie clothing,
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:492:414"/> or any dangerous diſtreſſe whereby our liues are in hazard, or any kind of violent and cruell tormenting death, able to ſeparate vs from the loue wherewith we are beloued of Chriſt, or to make vs leſſe beloued of him? Surely neither theſe nor any other euils that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall vs, or can come to vs, are able to do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in that the Apoſtle ſaith, who ſhall ſeparate vs, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true beleeuers, from that loue wherewith we are beloued of Chriſt, meaning this, that none can do it, neither Satan nor any inſtrument of his, by any euill they can bring on vs or do vnto vs; he points out plainly what Satan would do if he were able, and what Satan chiefly aimes at, namely, to ſeparate Gods children from the loue of God, and from the loue of Chriſt: and the point hence in the firſt place is this.</p>
               <p>That the thing that Satan chiefly aimes at and labours after <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> in all temptations, trials, croſſes, and euils that he brings on Gods children, is (if it were poſſible) to ſeparate them from the loue of God and Chriſt.

Thus de dealt with <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 73. he had almoſt tript vp his heeles, verſe 2. and he brought him to ſay in regard of his affliction, verſe 13. <hi>Certainly I haue cleanſed my heart in vaine, and waſhed mine hands in innocencie:</hi> I am not in fauour with God. And ſo <hi>Gideon,</hi> Iudg. 6.13. <hi>If the Lord be with vs, how then is all this come vpon vs?</hi> And this was Satans aime in <hi>Iobs</hi> affliction and trials, he ſpoiled him of his goods, and he vexed him grieuouſly in his bodie, not ſo much to make him poore or to hurt his bodie, as to make him blaſpheme or denie God, and to call into queſtion Gods loue towards him, Iob 1.11. And this was Satans chiefe aime in his tempting of Chriſt, Mat. 4. the ſpeciall thing he aymed at, was to make Chriſt call into queſtion his Fathers loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and the truth of that voice of his from heauen, Matth. 3.17. <hi>This is my beloued Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed:</hi> and to thinke, through vnbeliefe, that he was not the Sonne
<pb n="816" facs="tcp:492:415"/> of God, and therefore he comes on him with that, verſ. 3.6. <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God.</hi> And it is no maruell that Satan thus in all temptations and trials that he brings on Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, chiefly aymes at this, and labours what he can to ſhake out of their hearts the ſenſe and feeling of Gods loue to them, and to emptie their hearts of the perſwaſion of Gods loue towards them.</p>

And therefore doubtleſſe it is the thing Satan chiefly aimes at in all temptations, croſſes, trials, and afflictions he brings on Gods children, to ſhake out of their hearts the ſenſe and feeling of Gods loue to them, and to empty their hearts of the perſwaſion of Gods loue to them.</p>

And take thou heed when thou art vnder any temptation, triall, or croſſe, thou yeeld not to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan his owne concluſion, that becauſe thou art afflicted and that grieuouſly, therefore God loues thee not. <hi>It is an holy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke in this caſe to denie the concluſinn, though it be againſt the art of logicke, and learne thou thus to do when thou art vnder the greateſt trials and afflictions:</hi> labour thou to preſerue in thine heart a perſwaſion of Gods loue towards thee, that God ſtill loues thee though he do grieuouſly afflict thee, and ſo diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Satan of his aime, and of his drift in ſeeking to ſhake out of thine heart the feeling and perſwaſion of Gads loue to thee. <label type="milestone">

                  </label> Why, ſurely there be two ſpeciall things to
<pb n="817" facs="tcp:492:415"/> be done that ſerue to this purpoſe: I will briefly commend them to thee, marke them well.</p>
               <p>Firſt hold thou faſt this ground of truth, which is vndenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that Gods loue is moſt conſtant and vnchangeable as his owne bleſſed Maieſtie, with whom there is <hi>no variableneſſe, neither ſhadowing by turning,</hi> Iam. 1.17. and that nothing in the world can plucke his loue from his children, no not ſo much as hinder it or keepe it backe from them, and that a child of God once beloued of God in his beſt beloued the Lord Ieſus, is as deare to God in his greateſt diſtreſſe as in his greateſt proſperitie; and though his eſtate be changed, yet Gods loue towards him is not changed.</p>
               <p>And againe ſecondly, cleaue thou faſt to the word &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of God, that God will neuer withdraw his loue &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie from thee, though he do grieuouſly afflict thee, as he ſaid to <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2. Sam. 7.15. that which he ſaid to him, he ſaith to all his children, and cleaue thou faſt to this word of promiſe. And though the Lord hide his face from thee, &amp; his loue and mercie are ſo ouerſhadowed with the cloud of thy preſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions as they cannot be ſeene, yet cleaue thou faſt to his word and promiſe, euen to his bare word, when all other things for thy triall ſeeme contrarie to thee, and conſider that then the Lord hath a ſecret working for thy good, which thou canſt not ſenſibly perceiue. Thus did <hi>Abraham,</hi> as we find Rom. 4.18. <hi>Aboue hope he beleeued vnder hope:</hi> he hoped in God, and did cleaue faſt and cloſe to the promiſe of God againſt ſenſe and reaſon, and when all things ſeemed contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to him, he conſidering the power and ſecret working of the Lord. And if thou thus hold faſt that truth of God which cannot be gainſaid, that Gods loue is moſt conſtant and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, and if thou thus cleaue faſt to the word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, yea to the bare word, when all things for triall ſeeme contrarie to thee, thou ſhalt be able in thy greateſt diſtreſſe to preſerue in thine heart and ſoule a perſwaſion of Gods loue to thee; and ſo thou ſhalt fruſtrate Satan of his purpoſe, and diſappoint him of his aime and drift.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation,
<pb n="818" facs="tcp:492:416"/> or anguiſh, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſſe, or perill, or ſword?</hi> We ſee the Apoſtle here ſpeakes very boldly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, as it were by way of challenge, and by way of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph ouer Satan and all his inſtruments: <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt?</hi> as if he had ſaid, I defie the diuell and all his inſtruments, as able to ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt by any euill they can bring; I am ſure they are neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> to do it, I feare them not. See then, Gods children are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an holy manner bold and vndaunted,<note place="margin">Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are after an holy manner bold and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the euill of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward croſſes.</note> in reſpect of the euill of affliction &amp; outward croſſes. Without queſtion Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue in them a naturall feare of the euill of affliction and outward troubles and croſſes, as they be enemies to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and tend to the deſtruction of nature, and they are affraid of them ſo farre, as they are carefull to auoid them by all good and lawfull wayes &amp; meanes, and not to draw and pull them on themſelues needleſly, but they haue in them an holy boldneſſe, and courage, and vndauntedneſſe, in reſpect of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and outward troubles that come to them from the hand of God, which they cannot auoyd: and a child of God more feares the euill of ſinne then the euill of affliction. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſinne, a child of God quakes and trembles, and is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to ſwoune, &amp; euen to fall downe dead at the leaſt knowne ſinne, yet in reſpect of aduerſitie and outward troubles that do or may befall him, he is maruellous comfortable &amp; coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious in an holy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, vndaunted through the grace of faith in the promiſes of God. Dan. 3.16.17.18. we find that <hi>Shadrach Meſbach</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> were afraid to ſin againſt God by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe to worſhip <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> golden image, but they were nothing daunted nor appalled with the hot fierie fornace threatned againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for refuſing ſo to do.

<pb n="819" facs="tcp:492:416"/> it ſtrange that men will ſuffer themſelues to be feared with ſinnes, and that they will ſtand trembling at ſome ſinnes, that he accounts trifling. And againe, in reſpect of aduerſitie and outward trouble a child of God is bold and vndaunted, but there the wicked mans heart failes him, and there he ſhewes himſelfe a very coward: yea a bare conceit and ſuſpition of ſome outward trouble coming towards him, daunts him, and makes him tremble and quake. If then thou find thy ſelfe more afraid of the leaſt knowne ſinne, then thou art at the greateſt outward trouble, and thou hadſt rather vndergo the one then fall into the other, it is an euidence to thee that thy heart is right, and there is true grace in it: but if thou be bold in reſpect of ſinne, and a coward in regard of outward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and thou art more affraid of outward trouble then of ſinne, and thou more feareſt pouertie and loſſe of outward things then the breach of Gods commandements, as Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-breaking, vſing vnlawfull meanes to enrich thy ſelfe, ſurely it is a certaine note thou haſt not in thee the ſpirit and diſpoſition of a child of God, but the ſpirit and diſpoſition of a wicked and graceleſſe perſon.</p>

                  </label> as if Gods loue to his children in Chriſt did depend on ſomething in them, on their loue to him; and if their loue to him hold and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, then his loue to them holds and continues; and if their loue to God faile, then Gods loue to them failes and is drawne away from them, and ſo Gods loue to man is varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and changeable according to the alteration and change of mans loue to him: a conceit cleane contrarie to the plaine euidence of Scripture, and to the text we haue in hand, where the Apoſtle ſpeakes not conditionally, that nothing can ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt, we being true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, if we continue to loue him, but he ſpeakes poſitiuely &amp; abſolutely, that nothing is able to ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Againe, ſuch is the nature of Gods loue, and of Chriſt his loue to his, as it doth not onely abide and continue with them for euer, but it is alſo effectuall in them, and it keepes them continually in their loue to God, and it preſerues in their hearts a continuall loue to God and to Chriſt, ſo as their loue of God and of Chriſt can neuer be quite ſhaken out of their hearts, as the Lord ſaith by <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> Iere. 32.40. <hi>I will put my feare into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me:</hi> my loue to them ſhall be ſo effectuall, as it ſhall make them continue

               <p>Come we now to the ſecond generall layd before vs in this verſe, the Apoſtles ſecond affirmation propounded in more ſpeciall manner, by an enumeration and reckoning vp of diuerſe particulars, and that alſo by way of interrogation: <hi>Shall tribulation, or anguiſh, or perſecution, or famine, or naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or perill, or ſword?</hi> that is (as I ſhewed) neither tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither any preſſure or vexation, nor anguiſh, any perplexitie of mind, nor any extreme violence vſed to vs by tyrants and wicked men, whereby they purſue vs from place to place, nor want of neceſſarie food, nor want of neceſſary clothing, nor any dangerous diſtreſſe whereby our liues are in hazard, nor any kind of violent and cruell tormenting death: neither theſe nor any other euils that do or may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall vs, are able to ſeparate vs that are true beleeuers from that loue wherewith Chriſt loues vs, or wherewith God loues vs in Chriſt. In this enumeration, <hi>Shall tribulation, or anguiſh, or
<pb n="824" facs="tcp:492:419"/> perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſſe, or perill, or ſword?</hi> Our Apoſtle goes on from the leſſer to the greater, he begins with lighter troubles and riſeth vp by degrees to greater, and he putteth downe the particulars here mentioned, not caſually, but by ſingular art. Yea ſome obſerue, that the Apoſtles ſtile, here &amp; in the whole concluſion following to the end of the Chapter, is beautified with ſuch wonderfull eloquence and Rhetoricke, as neither <hi>Tullie</hi> nor <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> could euer haue ſpoken more eloquently. See then, the holy Spirit of God is pleaſed ſometimes to vſe eloquence, and the helpe of art, not ſuch eloquence as is in common vſe amongſt men, a whoriſh painted eloquence, ſtanding in vaine inuentions and frothy conceits of mens wit, but diuine graue eloquence, and ponderous and waightie, and ſuch as is powerfull to ſway the conſcience, and to moue the affections for the good of the ſoule. We are not then ſimplie to condeme eloquence, Rhetoricke, and other liberall arts and ſciences,<note place="margin">Rhetoricke &amp; other libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall arts and ſciences are not ſimply to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> as ſome foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly do, accounting them heatheniſh and antichriſtian; there is good vſe of them, if they be vſed in due place, and in a right manner, as ſeruants and handmaids to Diuinitie, but I paſſe by that.</p>
               <p>We ſee here our Apoſtle reſteth not in the generall, that none either man or diuell can ſeparate vs that are true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers from the loue of God in Chriſt, by any euill they do or can bring on vs, but he deſcends to particulars, and reckons vp particular euils, <hi>tribulation, and anguiſh, and perſecution, and famine, and nakedneſſe, and perill, and ſword:</hi> affirming that theſe cannot ſeparate true beleeuers from the loue of Chriſt; and in this Catalogue obſerue we, that the Apoſtle reckons vp the greateſt, and moſt bitter, and moſt ſhamefull euils that can befall true beleeuers in this world.

And that this is ſo, we may eaſily conceiue, in that the Lord promiſeth to be with his children in loue and mercie, euen in their particular euils, trials, and afflictions. Geneſ. 28.15. the Lord ſaith to <hi>Iaacob,</hi> Loe <hi>I am with thee, and will keepe thee whither ſoeuer thou goeſt.</hi> Iob 5.19.20.21. <hi>Eliphas</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Lord will deliuer his children in ſix troubles, and in the ſeuenth euill ſhall not touch them: and in famine he will deliuer them from death, and in battell from the power of the ſword: and they ſhall be hid from the ſcourge of the tongue, and ſhall not be afraid of destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction when it commeth.</hi> And ſo Pſal. 33.19. the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>The eye of the Lord is vpon his children, to deliuer them from death, and to preſerue them in famine.</hi> The Scripture is plentifull in this, and we find that the Lord hath bene with his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from time to time in loue and in mercie in their greateſt particular euils, trials, and afflictions that can or may befall them. As with <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in priſon, Gen. 39.21. with <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> in the hot fierie fornace, Dan. 3.25. with <hi>Ionah</hi> in the belly of the fiſh, Ion. 2.2. with the Apoſtles in priſon, Act. 5.19. with <hi>Paul</hi> in danger to loſe his life, Act. 24.25. with <hi>Peter</hi> in priſon, Act. 12.7.8. A cloud of witneſſes we haue to this purpoſe, all of them euidencing and confirming the truth of the point in hand, that particular euils, trials, and afflictions that befall Gods children, though moſt bitter, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly ſeuer Gods loue from them, nor them from Gods loue in Chriſt; neither any vexation of bodie, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie

And a kind and louing father loues his ſicke and weake child as dearely as if it were well and in perfect health and ſtrength: yea a true louing father then tenders his child more becauſe of the weakneſſe of it.

Reuerend <hi>Caluin</hi> obſerues, and <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> notes the ſame, that the Pſalme from which this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie is taken, deſcribes rather the horrible perſecution of the Church of God vnder <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> then vnder the Chaldeans in the 70. yeares captiuitie as ſome thinke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the people that were carried away to Babylon were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the Chaldeans for their idolatrie, but vnder <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> the people of God ſuffered for giuing teſtimonie to the Law of God: and therefore they complaine to God as we may reade verſ. 9. to the end of that Pſalme, that though they had not fallen away from the pure worſhip of God, verſe 17.18.19. <hi>Yet they were ſlaine continually, and counted as ſheepe for the ſlaughter,</hi> verſe 22.</p>
               <p>In this teſtimonie, <hi>For thy ſake are we killed all day long: we
<pb n="831" facs="tcp:492:422"/> are counted as ſheepe for the ſlaughter:</hi> it being a complaint of the Church and people of God vnder great affliction, we haue three materials to be obſerued.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, the greatneſſe of the ſufferings of the Church and people of God complained of, they were killed, they had their bloud ſhed violently, they were ſlaughtered, which is ſet out by a ſimilitude, they were as ſheepe appointed and drawne out to ſlaughter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, the cauſe of their ſufferings, not for their own ſinnes, but for the Lords ſake, <hi>For thy ſake are we killed all day long: we are counted as ſheepe for the ſlaughter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, the continuance of their ſufferings, put downe in theſe words, <hi>All day long. For thy ſake are we killed all day long.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs now examine the words of this verſe ſtanding on record in the booke of God in the holy Scripture:<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> he cites not the particular place, but deliuers in generall, <hi>As it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, For thy ſake.</hi> Theſe words carrie this ſence, as we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conceiue if we looke into the Pſalme out of which they are taken, as if the Church and people of God perſecuted had ſaid, for the confeſſion of thy name ô Lord, and for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of thy truth, euen becauſe we acknowledge thee one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be our God, and we worſhip thee alone, and will not be drawne from thy holy religion, and from the feare of thy name. Chriſt ſaith, Matth. 5.11. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you for my ſake:</hi> that is, for profeſſing my name, and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and truth of religion. <hi>Are we killed:</hi> that is, are we thy Church and people hardly and extremely dealt withall, and ſuffer extreame violence, ſometimes to the ſhedding of our bloud, and to the loſſe of our liues. <hi>All day long.</hi> Theſe words are diuerſly interpreted: the beſt and fitteſt expoſition is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually and without intermiſſion, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, 1. Corinth. 15.31. <hi>He dyed daily.</hi> And 2. Cor. 11.23. he was <hi>in death often:</hi> that is, continually in danger of death, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to it, for a man can dye but once, or be killed but once. <hi>We are counted as ſheepe for the ſlaughter:</hi> that is, our cruell perſecutors and bloudie minded enemies, make no more rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
<pb n="832" facs="tcp:492:423"/> of vs then of ſuch as are fit to be murdered &amp; ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and they make no more of taking away our liues on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſion, then a butcher doth of drawing out a ſheepe and cutting the throate of it at his pleaſure. And as the butcher thinkes he hath done well when he hath killed a ſheepe, and is glad when he hath ſo done, ſo are our. bloudie perſecutours glad when they can ſhed our bloud, and take away our liues, and they reioyce in it, and thinke that thy haue therein done good ſeruice to God, as Chriſt ſaith, Ioh. 16.2. <hi>The time ſhall come that whoſoeuer killeth you will thinke that he doth God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</hi> Now then thus conceiue we the meaning of the words of this verſe, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As we find it ſtanding on record in the booke of God, in the holy Scripture, the Church and people of God in former times haue iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complained to God on this manner: For the confeſſion of thy name O Lord, and for the profeſſion of thy truth, euen becauſe we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thee onely to be our God, and we worſhip thee alone, and will not be drawne from thy truth, and from the feare of thy name, we thy Church and people continually and without intermiſſion are extreamely ill dealt withall, and do ſuffer extreame violence, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the ſhedding of our bloud, and to the loſſe of our liues: yea our cruell parſecutours and bloudie minded enemies make no more reckoning of vs, then as of thoſe that are fit to be murdered and ſlaughtered: and they make no more account of taking away our liues, when they can on any occaſion, then a butcher doth of cutting the throate of a poore ſheepe: no they are glad when they can cruelly ſhed our bloud and take away our liues, and they reioyce in ſo doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now firſt from theſe words, <hi>As it is written,</hi> the Apoſtle here citing a place of Scripture ſeruing his purpoſe, and that out of the old Teſtament, I might ſtand to ſhew the harmonie that is betweene the old and new Teſtament, and the ſweete conſent of one part of Scripture with another, which indeed is an infallible note and marke by which we may know Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be Scripture, and the very word of God<note place="margin">The conſent of one part of Scripture with another, an infallible note that it is the very word of God.</note> breathed out by the holy Spirit; yea the quotations that the Lord Ieſus and his Apoſtles do bring out of the former writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, do manifeſt to vs what bookes written before the
<pb n="833" facs="tcp:492:423"/> Goſpell penned by <hi>Mathew</hi> the Euangeliſt are to be receiued as Canonicall Scripture, what bookes are to be reiected as not Canonicall, but I paſſe by theſe things, onely note we thus much. The Apoſtle here ſaith, <hi>It is written,</hi> and he names not the place where, he onely cites the words of Scripture out of Pſal. 44.22. &amp; ſaith, <hi>It is written:</hi> this is an vſuall thing both with Chriſt and with his Apoſtles. Matth. 4.4.7.10. Chriſt ſaith to Satan tempting him, <hi>It is written,</hi> not naming the places where. Yea Ioh. 7.38. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>He that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in me, as ſaith the Scripture, out of his bellie ſhall flow riuers of water of life.</hi> And yet the very words there put downe by him, are not found in any place of the old Teſtament, but may onely be gathered out of the writings of the Prophets, as out of Iſai. 44.3. Iſai. 49.10. Ioel 3.18. and ſuch like. So Heb. 2.6. the Author of that Epiſtle ſaith, <hi>One in a certaine place witneſſed ſaying: What is man that thou ſhouldest be mindfull of him, or the ſonne of man that thou wouldeſt conſider him?</hi> he cites <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> the words of the fourth verſe of Pſal. 8. but he names it not in particular: and ſo in diuerſe other places of Scripture, we find it an vſuall thing with Chriſt &amp; with his Apoſtles to cite the words of Scripture, not naming the particular places whence they are taken. And what muſt this teach vs? Surely thus much.</p>
               <p>That we ought to be ſo well acquainted with the written word of God, that when any place of Scripture is alledged, though the very Chapter or booke out of which it is taken be not named, yet we ſhould be able to know it, and to take notice of it to be Scripture,<note place="margin">We ought to be ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the written word of God, that when a place of Scripture is alledged, though the booke or Chapter out of which it is taken be not named, yet we ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to know it to be Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> and that ſuch words are indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the written word of God, though we cannot for the preſent call to mind the booke, chapter, or verſe where they are found.</p>
               <p>It is the fault of thouſands in the world, they know not the voice of God in his written word, <label type="milestone">

I am perſwaded a man in preaching might cite a ſentence of an heathen man, of a Poet, in the hearing of ſome, and tell them it is Scripture, and
<pb n="834" facs="tcp:492:424"/> they are not able to diſcerne it: a foule fault, and ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſufficiently taxed, eſpecially in theſe dayes, wherein we haue the written word of God not locked vp as among the Papiſts in a ſtrange tongue, but in our owne mother tongue, and we may heare it in publicke, and reade it in priuate, and come to be well acquainted with it. Thou then that art guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this fault, be ſtirred vp to reforme it, and neuer reſt till by hearing, and reading, and turning ouer the leaues of the booke of God, thou be ſo well acquainted with it, as when the words of Scripture are brought, and neither the verſe nor Chapter named, yet thou art able to know the ſentence to be a ſentence of Scripture, and that ſuch words indeed are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the written word of God, though for the preſent thou canſt not call to mind the particular place where they are found. I paſſe from that.</p>
               <p>One thing I will note further from the teſtimonie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture here brought by the Apoſtle in generall. In that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here cites a place out of the old Teſtament, to ſhew that the particular euils reckoned vp by him in the verſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, are ſuch as haue and do vſually befall the Church and children of God, and ſuch as ſtand on record in the booke of God as ordinarily befalling the children and people of God, he points out plainly thus much.</p>

When a child of God is vnder ſome great affliction, Satan is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly buſie with him, and he then labours to perſwade him, and to faſten this on him, that neuer was any afflicted as he is; and ſometimes he preuailes ſo farre with a deare child of God through his weakeneſſe, as he makes him crie out with the Church, Lam. 1.12. <hi>Was there euer any ſorrow like to my ſorrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Surely then on this ground as many as be the children of God, muſt make this reckoning and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to meete with as great troubles, trials, and afflictions, as euer did any of Gods children in former ages and times, and they muſt reſolue with themſelues to vndergo as hard trials, as euer did any of Gods children in the times of old. We may reade both in the booke of God, and in other ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yea in the ſtories of our owne land, that in former times,<note place="margin">Gods children muſt make account to vndergo as great trials &amp; afflictions now, as other of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue in former ages and times.</note> the conſtant profeſſion of Chriſt, of the truth of the Goſpell and religion, it hath coſt men and women the loſſe of friends, of goods, of libertie, yea of their deareſt bloud, and that by moſt cruell torments and tortures, by fire and fagot. Yea we daily heare of the troubles and diſtreſſes, and the great trials that the Church and people of God are vnder in forreine countries, and in our neighbour nations, that they are thruſt out of houſe and home, and moſt cruelly dealt withall by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting enemies. Now we muſt make account that the caſe may be our owne, and that we may be brought vnder the like troubles and trials, and vnder the like cruelties, and how ſoone we may ſo be we know not. A man that rightly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the euill of the times in which we liue, may eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne that the Lord is making way for heauie trials to be brought on vs, and we muſt ſet downe this as a concluſion in
<pb n="837" facs="tcp:492:425"/> our owne hearts, that the ſame euils, troubles, and afflictions, that haue befallen Gods people and children, either in the times of old or in our times, they may befall vs, and we are to reſolue with our ſelues to vndergo as hard trials as any of the children of God haue done heretofore, or as any of them do at this day; &amp; we muſt be readie in the preparation of our hearts willingly to beare them. It is the counſell of Chriſt himſelfe, Luke 14.28. to 34. that as wiſe builders caſt the charge of their buildings before they begin to build, and as good warriors conſider of their ſtrength before they go out to meet their enemies in the field, leſt they leaue off and turne backe like fooles and cowards: ſo ſhould we caſt our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count aforehand, and conſider with our ſelues what things may befall vs for our profeſſion of Chriſt and of his Goſpell, and reſolue with our ſelues not onely to beare mockes and ſcoffes, and nicknames, and reproches, but to endure the greateſt and bittereſt trials that we heare or reade of that any of Gods children haue endured or do endure, euen to the loſſe of our liues by moſt cruell torments, if the Lord be pleaſed to call vs to it for the conſtant profeſſion of his truth and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: and to that purpoſe to get our hearts ſtored with grace, that we may be able to ſtand in the day of triall, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelues with knowledge or common gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but to labour for the true ſauing grace of Gods Spirit, eſpecially to haue our hearts ſoundly <hi>rooted and grounded in the loue of God through faith,</hi> as Epheſ. 3.17. whereby we may be aſſured that God is our Father in Chriſt, Chriſt Ieſus our redeemer, and the holy Ghoſt our comforter &amp; ſanctifier; and then doubtleſſe we ſhall be able to hold out in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt trials that can befall vs.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the teſtimonie of Scripture, the words here alledged by the Apoſtle, <hi>For thy ſake are we killed all day long: we are counted as ſheepe for the ſlaughter.

                  </label> it followes that ſuch perſons as ſuffer for their errours and ſinnes, cannot poſſibly find true comfort in their ſufferings,<note place="margin">Such as ſuffer for their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours &amp; ſins, cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly find true comfort in their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</note> as the Papiſts bragge of their ſufferings, and are lift vp in a conceit that they merit heauen by them: but poore ſoules they can find no true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in them, they ſuffer but as fooles, no not thoſe amongſt them that ſuffer for their conſcience and for religion. To paſſe by them that are canonized for Saints and for Martyrs, who ſuffer death for no leſſe then monſtrous treaſon againſt their Princes, euen thoſe their perſecuted Catholicks (as they call them) who ſuffer for their religion, can take no true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in their ſufferings, they ſuffer not for the truth and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Chriſt, but for ſuperſtition and Antichriſtian hereſie, and their ſufferings cannot be truly comfortable to them. And ſo other erring ſpirits, Anabaptiſts, Separatiſts, and ſuch like, ſuffering for their owne fond opinions and fancies, they cannot poſſibly finde true comfort in their ſufferings. When they are iuſtly dealt againſt and cenſured by the Magiſtrate, they commonly crie out, and ſay they are perſecuted: alas, they are deceiued, their cenſure is not properly perſecution, but the iuſt hand of God on them for their groſſe errours. And howſoeuer they pleaſe themſelues in their ſufferings, yet aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly they cannot be truly comfortable to them. It is a true ſaying, not the ſuffering or puniſhment, but the cauſe for which a man ſuffers, that being good and any part of Gods truth, that is that which makes him a Martyr, and a witneſſe-bearer to the truth of God, and a comfortable ſufferer. And therefore looke thou to the cauſe of thy ſuffering of trouble, or thy enduring any hard meaſure from the hands of men in any kind whatſoeuer; and it thou ſuffer iuſtly for thine errour or ſinne, or for going beyond the compaſſe of thy place and calling, be humbled and repent of thy ſinnes, otherwiſe the

               <p>In the next place we are to conſider the greatneſſe of the ſuffering that the Church and people of God complaine of; they were killed, and they were counted as ſheepe for the ſlaughter: that is, (as I ſhewed) they were extremely ill dealt withall, and did ſuffer extreme violence and crueltie, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the ſhedding of their bloud, and the loſſe of their liues; and their cruell perſecutours and bloudy minded ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies made no more reckoning of them then as of ſuch as were fit to be murdered and ſlaughtered, and they made no more account of ſhedding of their bloud and taking away their liues by any crueltie, then the butcher doth of drawing out a ſheepe and cutting the throate of it. Hence then we may take notice of the ſauage diſpoſition and behauiour of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men and enemies, towards the Church and children of God: and the point hence is this.</p>

                  </label> the bitterneſſe of the paines do ſometimes ouercome Gods children, onely in their ſenſes, not in their inward faith and grace in their hearts, that ſtill remaines inuincible: and though it do not ſhew forth it ſelfe in the exerciſe of it for a time, yet in the roote it ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines vnſhaken, and that ſtrange behauiour of a child of God is as nothing in Gods account, the Lord paſſeth by it.

               <p>Againe, Gods children are as great and glorious conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ouer the euils, troubles, and trials themſelues, by ſome wonderfull and ſtrange deliuerance, as when they are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully deliuered out of them,<note place="margin">Secondly, by ſome won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull and ſtrange deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance out of them.</note> either by the immediate hand and power of God, as the people of Iſrael were out of the hands of the Egyptians at the red ſea, Exod. 14. and the three companions of <hi>Daniel</hi> out of the hot fierie fornace, Dan. 3.26. and <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelfe out of the Lyons den, Dan. 6.22. and <hi>Peter</hi> out of priſon, Act. 12.11. or by ſome ſtrange meanes, as <hi>Saul</hi> was, Act. 9.25. the text ſaith, <hi>The diſciples tooke him by night, and put him through the wall, and let him downe in a basket, and ſo he eſcaped out of the hands of the Iewes, who watched the gates day and night to kill him.</hi>

<pb n="852" facs="tcp:492:433"/> great and glorious conquerours, and that here in this world, ouer the diuell, and ouer wicked men, that vexe, and trouble, and perſecute them, and deale moſt hardly and cruelly with them: for what is the diuels aime in the afflictions of Gods children? Surely as I ſhewed heretofore, to wreſt from them their confidence in Gods loue, to make them murmure, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, and deſpaire, and to make a breach betweene God and them: now herein is the diuell diſappointed, Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their particular trials &amp; troubles draw nearer to God, and cleaue faſter to him, their afflictions <hi>bring forth patience, and their patience experience</hi> of Gods gracious preſence and aſſiſtance, as Rom. 5.3.4. yea Gods children are ſtirred vp in their afflictions to be more feruent in prayer to God, as <hi>Paul</hi> was when he was buffeted of Satan, 2. Cor. 12.8. And what is it that wicked men in their vexing and troubling of Gods children, and in dealing moſt hardly with them driue at? Surely to make them to denie Chriſt, and to ſhrinke from their holy profeſſion and religion, but therein they faile of their porpoſe, Gods children are thereby more ſtrengthened and confirmed in their confeſſion of the name of Chriſt, and in their holy profeſſion of the truth and Goſpell of Chriſt, and many times by their courage and conſtancie they do euen daunt the minds of their perſecutours, and their very enemies ſtand amazed and wonder at them, and ſay as the chiefe Prieſts and Scribes ſaid, Act. 4.16. <hi>What ſhall we do to theſe men?</hi> A ſpeech worth the noting, they that had power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon the Apoſtles, or to do with them what they would, ſtand amazed &amp; know not what to do, to poore, weake, vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and friendleſſe men: and thus we find that many times the barbarous cruelttie of the perſecuting Emperours was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen altered with the ſtedfaſtneſſe of the Saints in ſuffering. And though Gods children ſuffer grieuous things, and die vnder the hands of their cruell tormentours, yet in regard of their conſtancie they are conquerours, and go away with a glorious victorie. Thus then we ſee this truth cleared and confirmed particularly, that Gods children in all the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that befall them, euen in their particular euils and trials,
<pb n="853" facs="tcp:492:433"/> are as great conquerours here in this world, both ouer the euils and trials themſelues, and alſo ouer the diuel and wicked men, that vexe, and trouble, and perſecute them, and deale moſt hardly and cruelly with them. <label type="milestone">

This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a paradoxe, and ſuch a thing as nature, reaſon, and the world vnderſtand not; but ſo it is, euen then are they as great conquerours in their courage, conſtancie, patience, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfort: yea when Gods children are in the extremitie of paine, and their paine makes them ſhew forth ſtrange be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, euen then are they inuincible in their faith, and their inward grace is impregnable, all the power of hell not able to ouercome it: and if we iudge otherwiſe of them then of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours, ſurely we iudge amiſſe, and we <hi>ſinne againſt the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Gods children,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaks, Pſal. 73.15. and let vs take heed of ſo doing.</p>
               <p>And for a ſecond vſe: Is it ſo that true beleeuers and Gods <label type="milestone">

Surely then on this ground we may eaſily ſee, that a child of God is in a moſt happie and comfortable ſtate and condition, and is as a rocke in the ſea, which being beaten with waues on euery ſide, yet ſtands firme and vnmoueable; yea a child of God is endued with ſuch ſtrength of grace, as that he is too ſtrong for the diuell and for all the power of hell, and the diuell and all his inſtruments are not able by all the euils and troubles they can bring on him, to ouercome his faith, and to get the victorie ouer the grace that is in him; though they may aſſault him and ſhake him, yet they can neuer as it were throw him on his backe and ouercome him, they cannot do him that miſchiefe they intend againſt him. The perſecutors and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church and children of God, may ſhed the bloud of Gods children, and take away their liues, yet when they ſo do, themſelues go away vanquiſhed, and Gods children are the conquerours; and they do but as it were put a garland or crowne of victorie on their heads whom they kill and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and thinke they haue ouercome. Oh then happie and comfortable is the ſtate of Gods children, they are in a more ſure and ſetled eſtate then the mightieſt Monarch in the world. Who can ſay, and that truly, though many thouſands of armed ſouldiers encompaſſe him for his defence, that he is in ſuch a ſure ſtate, as that none can ouercome him? No, no, ſuch is the ſtate of euery child of God, he is ſure, in all euils, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, trials, and afflictions that befall him, to ſtand faſt, and to go away with the victory. The conſideration of this ought to ſtirre vs vp to labour to get into the number of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: if thou be of that number, thou art then in a moſt ſure ſtate and condition, the diuell, and all the power of hell, &amp; all the inſtruments of the diuell, cannot then by any euill, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or triall, they can bring on thee, ouercome thy faith and that grace that is in thee; and in the heate of trouble and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of perſecution, thou mayeſt then laugh at thy perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,

And for this we haue further euidence and teſtimony of Scripture, Iſai. 54.10. ſaith the Lord, <hi>The mountaines ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue, and the hils ſhall fall downe, but my mercie or my loue ſhall not depart from thee, neither ſhall the couenant of my peace fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſaith the Lord:</hi> as if he had ſaid, though the whole world be turned vp-ſide downe, and heauen and earth come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and be remooued out of their places, yet ſhall not my loue be remooued from my children: in the greateſt confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of things, my loue, my mercie, and my compaſſion ſhall ſtill abide with them. Matth. 16.18. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The gates of hell, the power of hell, ſhall not preuaile againſt the faith of his Church</hi> and of true beleeuers: all the cunning and ſtrength of the diuell and his Angels ſhall neuer be able to ouercome the faith of true beleeuers; and if not the faith of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, ſurely not the loue of God to them, that being more firme and more inuincible: and indeed in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all it cannot be ſeuered from ſuch as continue true beleeuers. Ioh. 10.28.29. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I giue my ſheepe eternall life, and they ſhall neuer periſh, neither ſhall any plucke them out of mine hand.

And hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, 2.

Is the bodie of a child of God beloued of God, when it is ſeuered from the ſoule, when it lyes dead and is voide of ſenſe and feeling? Is it then deare to God when it is not ſenſible of any comfort? Surely then it holds ſound and good, that a man or a woman may be right deare to God, and in ſpeciall fauour with God, and yet want the feeling of his loue for a time. And do not thou whoſoeuer thou art, thou finding that God hath done great good things for thy ſoule, euen that for thee which he hath not done for thouſands in the world, he hath giuen thee a ſight of thy ſinnes, an heart truly humbled for them, a minde to know him, an heart to feare him, a care and conſcience to obey God: do not thou I ſay, perplex thy ſelfe, and diſquiet thine owne ſoule, becauſe haply for the preſent thou wanteſt the feeling of Gods loue to thee: conſider with thy ſelfe, thou maiſt be right deare to God, and be loued of him in ſpeciall manner, and yet for the preſent be as inſenſible of his loue, and haue no more feeling of it then a dead bodie, eſpecially in the time of trouble and diſtreſſe, and in the time of temptation. And though the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of comfort from God in the time of diſtreſſe be a fruite
<pb n="877" facs="tcp:492:445"/> and worke of faith, yet a man or a woman may haue faith that for the preſent wants the ſenſe and feeling of comfort. <hi>Indeed none are in a good ſtate that want faith,</hi>

Here is then a ground of ſweet comfort to all Gods children againſt the feare of death:<note place="margin">Sweete com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to all Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the feare of death</note> the truth now deliuered being mingled with faith in the hearts of Gods children, it will arme and ſtrengthen them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the feare of death, and cheere vp their hearts in the paines and pangs of death, of what kind ſoeuer it be, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo bitter and painfull. What though a child of God be vnder ſome bitter and grinding diſeaſe of the ſtone, of a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning feuer, and the heate of it is ſo fierce and ſo violent and ſtrong on him, as in his owne ſenſe and feeling he ſeemes to lye in flames of fire? What though a child of God be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by a violent death, either ſuddenly by ſome ſtrange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, as he fals from ſome high place, or from his horſe, and his braines are daſht out, or he is drownd, or ſuch like, or his life is taken from him by his cruell perſecutours, and they put him to moſt wofull racke and tortures, and they caſt his body to be deuoured of wilde beaſts, or to be meate <hi>to the foules of the ayre,</hi> as Pſal. 79.20. they drag his body through the ſtreets, they hang him on a gibbet, they burne him, and put him to death after a moſt cruell manner? yet it is not the kinde of death or manner of death whatſoeuer it be, that can poſſibly breake off or keepe backe Gods loue from him, or ſeparate either his ſoule or bodie from Gods ſpeciall loue. Oh then let this ground of truth be mingled with faith in our hearts,
<pb n="878" facs="tcp:492:446"/> we being the children of God, and we ſhall find it will ſtand by vs and comfort vs when we lye gaſping for breath on our death beds, and it will arme vs againſt the feare of death, of what ſort ſoeuer it be. 1. Sam. 30.6. we finde that when the people were readie to ſtone <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaw nothing but preſent death before him, the text ſaith, <hi>Dauid comforted himſelfe in the Lord his God.</hi> The words are full of weight, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the apprehenſion of death, as <hi>Dauid</hi> thought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auoidable, he apprehended the mercie of God in the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and he perſwaded himſelfe that death could not ſeuer him from his God, and from the loue of God, and thereupon he cheered vp his heart, and was comforted. So doubtleſſe if the truth now deliuered be ſetled in our hearts and mingled with faith, we ſhall find it will miniſter matter of ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vnto vs in the bittereſt paines that can befall vs, and it will ſtrengthen vs againſt the feare of death, of what kinde ſoeuer it be, and be it neuer ſo bitter and painfull: <hi>Neither death, nor life</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſhall be able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God which is in Christ Ieſus our Lord.</hi> By <hi>life</hi> (as I ſhewed) we are to vnderſtand the life of the bodie, and the pleaſures, profits, and honours that do accompanie it. Now the point hence offered I need not ſtand on, for euery one who knowes things aright, will confeſſe that the life of the bodie and the good things of this life, health, wealth, peace, plentie, honour, and ſuch like, cannot poſſibly breake off or keepe backe Gods loue from his children: for indeed both life it ſelfe and the good things of this life, are bleſſings of God in themſelues, and to Gods children they are giuen as bleſſings in mercie, and Gods children haue right and title to them in Chriſt, and to the lawfull vſe of them, and they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to them as pledges of Gods loue, and faith ſanctifies all outward good things to Gods children; and therefore they cannot poſſibly breake off or keepe backe Gods loue from his children: I will not therefore ſtand on it. But it may ſeeme ſtrange why the Apoſtle ſhould here reckon life among the things that cannot ſeparate Gods children from Gods loue, meaning by life, as ye haue heard, the life of the bodie, and
<pb n="879" facs="tcp:492:446"/> the good things of this life: ſurely herein appeares the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <label type="milestone">

Haue not ſome at one time or other thus reaſoned and thought with themſelues, Surely God giues me a good meaſure of health and ſtrength, and a competent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of outward good things, and I am not in ſuch affliction as I ſee other of Gods children are, and am I a child of God? I doubt whether God loue me or no. This is ſometimes the reaſoning and thought of a child of God: and ſure I am, I haue knowne a deare child of God thus to reaſon, and thus to thinke in reſpect of inward trials, and in the time of ſickneſſe hath thus ſpoken, I finde my ſelfe not buffeted by Satan, and ſo aſſaulted by him as I haue knowne ſome of Gods deare children in the time of their ſickneſſe, and when they haue drawne neare to their end; my conſcience is quiet, and I find peace in my ſoule, am I a child of God? See the cunning of a ſubtill enemie: and thus doubtleſſe it is ſometimes in reſpect of outward good things and freedome from euils. Now this the holy Spirit of God here preuents, in that he ſaith, that life, and the good things of this life, cannot ſeparate from the loue of God: <label type="milestone">

               <p>And againe, there is a perpetuitie euen of the loue of true <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> beleeuers: they hauing their hearts once poſſeſſed with true loue to God and to the Saints of God by the worke of the Spirit, they cannot be vtterly deſtitute of that loue, that loue of theirs <hi>ſhall neuer vtterly fall away,</hi> 1. Cor. 13.8. And the loue of true beleeuers towards God and towards men begun in this life, ſhall continue for euer in the life to come, and in heauen it ſhall be in full perfection: and much more is the loue of God to his children perpetuall, and ſhall neuer faile, or be broken off by any euent whatſoeuer. And therefore
<pb n="882" facs="tcp:492:448"/> doubtleſſe this we may reſolue on as a certaine truth, that no euent, no falling out and coming to paſſe of things in this world whatſoeuer, can poſſibly breake off or keepe backe Gods loue from his children.</p>
               <p>Now for the vſe of this: I might bend the force of this truth againſt that erronious conceit of ſome, that a child of God cannot be ſure of his continuance in the loue of God. Some erring ſpirits ſay, that a child of God may now for the preſent be aſſured of Gods loue to him, but he cannot be ſo for the time to come: they ſay God continues to loue his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren if they continue to loue him, but if they be diuerted &amp; turned aſide by ſome euent from their loue to God, then God ceaſſeth to loue them; a conceit directly contrarie to the plaine euidence of the word of God, and to the truth now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered: we haue often had occaſion to deale againſt it, I paſſe by it, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> and for the vſe of the truth deliuered: It may ſerue to arme and ſtrengthen Gods children againſt the feare of variable euents and falling out of things here in this world;<note place="margin">How Gods children may be armed &amp; ſtrengthened againſt the feare of the variable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of things here in this world.</note> this world is a place of continuall alteration and changing, <hi>The face and faſhion of the world is variable, and goeth away,</hi> 1.

Now in all alterations and changes that be in the world, here is the ſtay and comfort of the child of God, that Gods loue to him ſtill abides with him, and is neuer changed: and though it be with a child of God as with other men, he cannot tell what ſhall befall him hereafter, as the common ſaying is, a man knowes his beginning, but he knowes not his end, and things to come are doubtfull and vncertaine, though witches, wizards, and ſuch inſtruments
<pb n="883" facs="tcp:492:448"/> of the diuell will take on them to foretell things to come; but I ſay, though a child of God know not what ſhall come to him to morrow, and in the time to come, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, Acts 20.22. <hi>I go bound in the Spirit to Ieruſalem, and know not what things ſhall come vnto me there:</hi> yet here is his comfort, he knowes this, that come what will come, or what can come, either in the world or in his owne particular perſon, no euent whatſoeuer it be can poſſibly breake off or keepe back Gods loue from him: and though his ſtate be changed, yet Gods loue to him is not changed, that is ſtill the ſame; and what a comfort may this be to a child of God? Who can ſay and ſay truly, that his ſtate is ſuch in regard of his bodie and outward eſtate, as no euent can change it, or remoue him from it? Surely none liuing on the face of the earth. <hi>Dauid</hi> indeed ſaid, Pſal. 30.6. <hi>That he ſhould neuer be remooued:</hi> but he found it otherwiſe, as himſelfe ſaith, verſe 7. <hi>The Lord hid his face, and he was troubled,</hi> onely the child of God is in ſuch a firme ſtate and condition in reſpect of Gods loue, as that nothing that befals him can remoue him from that: things to come cannot poſſibly breake off or keepe backe Gods loue from him. And that may be a ground of ſweet comfort to vs, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the children of God, and if we be able to mingle it with faith in our hearts, we ſhall find it will comfort vs amidſt the hurlie burlies, and changes, and greateſt alterations of things that fall out here in this world.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the laſt words of verſe 39. which is, <hi>in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi> Theſe words as heretofore I haue made knowne, are a ſecond amplification of the Apoſtles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that nothing can ſeparate Gods children from the loue of God; and they containe the ground of Gods loue to his children, that it is grounded not on any thing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but on Chriſt Ieſus: and the point hence offered in the firſt place, is this. <label type="milestone">

God loues his children moſt dearely,<note place="margin">The ground of Gods loue to his children is onely in Chriſt Ieſus.</note> and the ground of his loue to them is not in themſelues, nor in any creature in heauen or earth, but onely in Chriſt. Indeed it is true, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
<pb n="884" facs="tcp:492:449"/> an obiection in the beginning, God loues his owne i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, the ſtampe of his grace, and the worke of his good Spirit, namely holineſſe and ſanctification where he finds it in his children, but the ground of that worke is his loue to them in Chriſt his Sonne, he loues them in Chriſt, and out of that loue of his to them in Chriſt, he is pleaſed to worke on their ſoules to their ſanctification. So the ground of his loue to them is in Chriſt Ieſus: and hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, Epheſ. 1.3. <hi>That God euen the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, hath bleſſed vs with all ſpirituall bleſſing in heauenly things:</hi> and then he ſubioynes <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Chriſt the ground of all ſpirituall bleſſings, and of all the fruites of Gods loue to his children.

Corinth. 1.30. <hi>Christ is made to vs of God, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and redemption.</hi> And ſo in many other places we find that Chriſt is the ground and foundation of all good things that come from God to his choſen: <label type="milestone">

               <p>Now as in theſe words the Apoſtle makes knowne to vs that the ground of Gods loue to his children is in Chriſt, ſo alſo that Gods ſpeciall loue comes to them in and through Chriſt Ieſus: and the point hence offered in the next place is this. <label type="milestone">

Gods loue to his children is in God as the fountaine, and from him it flowes out as from a fountaine; and Chriſt Ieſus is as it were the conduit or pipe by which it is conuaid to them. And to this purpoſe is that, Ioh. 1.17. <hi>Grace came by Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> the free grace, loue and fauour of God, that comes to men in and through Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. And we reade that at the birth of Chriſt the Angels publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.

Admit they haue health, and wealth, and abundance of the good things of this life, yea admit they haue grace in their ſoules, as the common gifts and graces of the Spirit they haue wit, learning, and knowledge, and that of heauenly things, yea they haue power to abſtaine from ſome groſſe ſinnes, and ſuch like, yet none of theſe things are tokens and fruites of Gods ſpeciall loue to them. Indeed many that haue no eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their being in Chriſt, are readie to ſooth vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in a conceit of Gods ſpeciall loue to them in reſpect of theſe things, and they ſticke not to ſay, that God hath bleſt them with health, and with wealth, and with many good things, and they perſwade themſelues God loues them in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner. And if men and women be endued with ciuill honeſtie, if they liue ciuilly and orderly in the world, oh then they haue a maruellous ſtrong conceit that they are highly beloued of God, and highly in the fauour of God, and we cannot driue them from that conceit. Poore ſoules, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue themſelues, there is no partaking in Gods ſpeciall loue nor in any token or fruite of his loue out of Chriſt. And know it whoſoeuer thou art, and take it home to thee; thou being out of Chriſt, thy health, thy wealth, and good things of this life thou doſt enioy, they are not giuen to thee in mercie, and
<pb n="888" facs="tcp:492:451"/> as tokens and fruites of Gods ſpeciall loue, and thou doſt from thence but falſly conclude that thou art beloued of God in ſpeciall manner. And know further, if thou haue no better euidence of thy being in Chriſt then thy ciuill honeſty, ſurely thou doſt but reſt on a ſtaffe of reede, and I dare boldly tell thee, that as yet thou art not in Chriſt, and being not in Chriſt, the grace that is in thy ſoule, the power thou haſt to abſtaine from groſſe ſinnes, and to do ſome good duties, the good gifts that are beſtowed on thee, as wit, memorie, knowledge of good things, learning, and ſuch like, are not fruits of Gods ſpeciall loue to thee, they are but ſuch things as God may and doth many times beſtow on reprobates, and ſuch as ſhall be damned; they come to thee onely from the hand and prouidence of God, and not from his ſpeciall loue, and they can yeeld thee no true comfort. And therefore do not thou ſo deceiue thine owne ſoule, as thereupon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that thou art beloued of God with his ſpeciall loue, and with that loue he beares to his children.

If then thou wouldſt find comfort in Chriſt, learne thou to make him thy Lord, and ſuffer him to rule in thine heart and life by the ſcepter of his word, and by the power of his Spirit. For then indeed is Chriſt thy Lord, when the power of his grace hath preheminence in thee, and preuailes ouer the inward ſtrength of thine owne corruption, and ouer ſuch outward power as draweth men to ſinne, the temptations of Satan, the allurements of the world: and this thou muſt find in thy ſelfe if thou wouldſt find true comfort in Chriſt, and be aſſured that he is thy Sauiour.</p>
